      <span class="smcap">Silver</span> printing has been often doomed, but it still
      survives. Other processes of photographic printing have been introduced, nearly
      all of them having their individual merits, especially that of permanency, but
      all lacking in two essential qualities&mdash;ease of production and beauty
      of result. In these particulars no process has ever approached the one
      to the working of which this little book is devoted. The one defect of
      silver printing is the possibility of its results fading; but surely
      it is better to be beautiful, if fading, than permanent and ugly. It
      is better to be charmed with a beautiful thing for a few years, than
      be bored by an ugly one for ever. But is silver printing necessarily
      a fading process? We have in our possession a large number of silver
      photographs produced from twenty to twenty-five years ago, which are
      as perfect in tone and colour as when they were produced. Carefully
      prepared, and properly kept, a silver print should be as permanent as
      any other. That silver prints should be permanent as well as beautiful,

    <small>THEORY OF SILVER PRINTING.</small></h2>

    <p class="noi">
      <span class="smcap">Perhaps</span> it may be wise, first of all, to give the
      reader some account of the manner in which the subject of silver printing
      is to be treated, before entering into very minute details, so that it may be followed
      as a whole, instead of being studied in fragments, a course which is
      sure to lead to failure, from a want of comprehending what may have
      been skipped. To understand "the why" and "the wherefore" of every
      detail is an essential in most occupations, and it is wonderful that
      photographers are satisfied with the results of rule-of-thumb formulæ,
      instead of reasoning out their utility. In the following pages most of
      the theoretical considerations will be brought out in such a manner that
      everyone will be able to understand them, provided only that there is a
      slight acquaintance with the name and properties of the chemicals which
      are dealt with.
    </p>


    <h3>PRELIMINARY EXPERIMENTS.</h3>

    <p>

      Into a glass beaker put a couple of pinches of common salt, which must
      be dissolved in a little water.
    </p>

    <p>
      In a test-tube<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote-1" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1">[1]</a> dissolve about an equal amount of silver nitrate
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>(AgNO<sub>3</sub>),
      and add it to the salt solution. We shall find that we have an
      immediate precipitate, for chloride of silver will be formed by what
      is called double<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote-2" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2">[2]</a>
      decomposition, and there will remain in solution
      a soluble salt known as sodium nitrate. When the silver chloride has
      settled down, decant off the liquid, and add water to it once or twice,
      draining off each time. Divide the chloride into four parts, placing
      each part on a strip of glass. On two of them pour a little common salt
      solution, and on the other two pour a little solution of silver nitrate;
      take one of each pair, and place it in a dark cupboard (if warmed,
      the quicker will be the operation) to dry. Take the other two moist
      portions of chloride into the open air, and expose them to daylight, and
      note the results. It will be seen that one of these will darken very
      rapidly to a violet colour, whilst the other will remain much lighter,
      though perceptibly blackening. After a time the latter will appear to
      grow deeper, whilst the former will become a deep black. The one that
      blackens most rapidly will be found to be that one on which the silver
      nitrate was poured. Divide the slightly blackened chloride on the strip
      of glass into two portions, and over one pour a little beer, and over
      the other a weak solution of potassium nitrite, and again note the
      difference. It will be found that here the blackening commences anew,
      but proceeds much more rapidly on that portion over which the nitrite
      was poured. Here are the experiments. What do they teach?
    </p>

    <p>
      Potassium nitrite, and silver nitrate, are both inorganic salts, and
      they both have an affinity for&mdash;that is, tend to combine with&mdash;any
      of the halogens (by which are meant such bodies as chlorine, iodine,
      bromine, and fluorine). In the former case we have silver chloride
      formed with a little hypo-chlorous acid; in the latter we have a more
      difficult decomposition: the potassium
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>nitrite
      is decomposed into hydrochloric acid and potassium nitrate.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote-3" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 3">[3]</a>
    </p>

    <p>
      We can tell that chlorine is liberated by the action of light on silver
      chloride, since if we prepare some as above, well wash it, and expose it
      to light in pure water, we shall find that the latter contains chlorine,
      since a few drops of silver nitrate poured into it after exposure give a
      white precipitate.
    </p>

    <p>
      If we make the same experiments with the dried portions of silver
      chloride as we did with the moist, we shall obtain the same results,
      with the exception that with the dried, in which there is excess of
      salt, there will be hardly any discolouration. The experimentalist
      should also note that if the darkened chloride be broken up, the
      interior retains its white colour in all its purity. This tells us that
      the discolouration is <em>almost</em> confined to the surface, hence it is
      useless, for printing purposes, to have such a mass of chloride as would
      be opaque, since all but a very thin film would be unacted upon.
    </p>

    <p>
      If the darkened chloride be examined closely, it will be seen that
      the colour varies, being bluer in the case of that which has silver
      nitrate in contact with it (either moist or dry) as compared with that
      which is darkened in contact with the potassium nitrite. We have the
      best of reasons for believing that the blue colour is really due to a
      combination between the sub-chloride and the oxygen contained in the
      water or in the air. The true colour of the sub-chloride is that which
      is exposed beneath an oxygen absorbent such as the nitrite.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
      Practical printers are aware that albumenized paper containing a
      chloride is employed for producing silver prints, and the probability is
      that the albumen must exercise some kind of influence on the resulting
      picture. Let us examine this, and see what effect it can have. Carefully
      break an egg, and separate the yolk from the white, pouring the latter
      into a beaker. Beat up the white with a bundle of quill pens, allow the
      froth to subside, and then filter it. Pour a little of the filtered
      albumen (the white of egg) into a test-tube, and add a little silver
      nitrate solution to it, and expose the precipitate which falls to light.
      It will be seen that it darkens rapidly, assuming a foxy red colour.
      Take a couple of glass plates and coat them with plain collodion, wash
      under the tap, and whilst still moist flow albumen over them two or
      three times, and set them up to dry. When thoroughly dry, plunge them
      for a few seconds into a weak solution of silver nitrate (30 grains
      to the ounce of water will suffice), wash one under the tap, and then
      allow both to dry again. Take both plates out into the light, and note
      the results. The one from which the silver nitrate has not been washed
      will darken very rapidly, the other will take some time to start; but if
      the exposure be sufficiently prolonged, it will gradually assume a hue
      equally as dark as the other.
    </p>

    <p>
      If we repeat these experiments with gelatine, which is used as a sizing
      in some papers, we shall find very much the same nature of things taking
      place, the differences being so slight, however, as not to require
      detailed notice.
    </p>

    <p>
      So far, then, we have considered the darkening properties of the silver
      compounds which are to be used by the printer, but it remains to be
      seen what <em>permanency of darkening</em> they possess. If we treat the
      darkened silver chloride solution exposed with the silver nitrate or
      the potassium nitrite to a solution of hyposulphite of soda or ammonia,
      both of which are solvents of the white chloride, we shall find that
      a residue of metallic silver is left behind. If we treat the darkened
      albuminate of silver with the same agents, we shall find that very
      little change is effected by them.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
      From this we may gather that the action of light on them is of a totally
      different nature.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote-4" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 4">[4]</a> This is also most marked if we treat the two with
      hydrosulphuric acid solution (sulphuretted hydrogen<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote-5" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 5">[5]</a>). It will be
      found that the colour of the darkened silver chloride becomes more
      intense, while the other is bleached, or, rather, becomes of a yellow
      tint. This last effect has an important bearing on the permanency of
      silver prints, as will be more fully explained when considering the
      subject of fixing the print.

    <small>PREPARATION OF ALBUMENIZED PAPER.</small></h2>

    <p class="noi">
      <span class="smcap">In</span> printing on albumenized paper we must divide the operations, and give
      a detailed account of each. In case the reader may desire to prepare his
      own paper, we give the following formula and directions.
    </p>

    <p>
      To prepare the albumen, procure a sufficient number of eggs, remembering
      that the white of a large egg will be about a fluid ounce; have a cup
      to collect the yolks, and a four-ounce measure at hand. Give the centre
      of the egg a smart blow against the top of the cup. The shell can now
      be readily pulled in two, the yolk remaining unbroken with part of the
      albumen in one half, and the rest of the albumen in the other half of
      the shell. Take the halves, one in each hand, and pour the albumen from
      one to the other, holding them over the small measure. As the operation
      continues, the yolk will gradually separate, the white falling into the
      vessel below. If conducted with care, the whole of the latter will be
      collected without breaking the yolk. If the yolk break, some will be
      sure to find its way into the measure along with the white, and this,
      together with the white speck known as the tread, must be rigorously
      taken out by means of a spoon. The <em>uncontaminated</em> white is then poured
      into a large jar. If the operator carefully <a name="collects" id="collects"></a><ins title="Original has collect">collects</ins> the white of each
      egg into the four-ounce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span> ounce measure first, he will find his labour
      much diminished, as it is awkward to get out the small pieces of yolk
      from a large quantity of albumen. The eggs are thus broken, and the
      white collected till there is a sufficient quantity for the purpose
      in hand. Suppose we are going to make up 20 ounces of solution, then
      about 18 ounces of white of egg must be found in the jar. One point
      to settle is the amount of salt to be used to each ounce of albumen.
      It must be recollected that a medium quantity is the best for medium
      negatives; anything between 20 and 40 grains per ounce may be used.
      We prefer ourselves about 25. Supposing this quantity to be used, we
      proceed to dissolve 500 grains of chloride of ammonium in 2 ounces of
      water, and add it to the albumen. It has been proved that as regards
      colour of the picture, it does not matter what chloride is used. To
      prevent crystallization, it is better to use ammonium, which contains
      a greater amount of chlorine than do sodium or potassium chlorides. It
      must now be beaten up till it is in a froth. This breaks up the fibrous
      matter, and on subsidence the liquid will be found to be limpid. The
      most convenient implement with which to beat up the albumen is the
      American egg-beater. Three or four minutes' work is quite sufficient
      to make the whole into a froth. An ordinary culinary whisk, such as is
      used in the kitchen, may also be put into requisition, or, in default
      of that, a bundle of quill pens. A lesson in producing a froth can be
      learnt from the cook of the establishment. When the salted albumen has
      settled it must be filtered, which, perhaps, is best effected through
      a sponge, though glass-wool is a capital substitute. In either case a
      small, loosely-fitting plug is placed in the neck of an ordinary funnel,
      and, after rinsing with cold water, the albumen is poured in, and
      allowed to filter through slowly. It is advisable to avoid bubbles as
      far as possible, and the accompanying arrangement will be found to avoid
      their formation. The funnel is placed in the position shown (<a href="#fig1">fig. 1</a>);
      the capillary attraction between it and the glass will cause the drops
      to trickle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span> down the side, and collect, without bubbles, at the bottom.
      This little contrivance will be found of use in other operations besides
      that of silver printing, and should be made a note of. The albumen may
      also be filtered through one, two, or three thicknesses of muslin,
      according to its fineness, tied over the mouth of a bottle or beaker of
      which the bottom has been removed. The albumen is placed in a vessel
      slightly larger than the filter, which is allowed to sink gradually.
      When full it is withdrawn, and the fluid poured into the dish. By this
      plan upward filtration is established. The fluid may be poured into the
      filter itself, and used in the ordinary manner.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote-6" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 6">[6]</a>

    </div>

    <p>
      On a larger scale, white of eggs in a fresh condition can be obtained
      from egg merchants who utilize the yolks by selling them to the grocers
      and confectioners. Albumen can be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span> obtained by the gallon in this
      condition, according to the price of eggs. It will be evident that
      there is considerable economy in taking the whites wholesale. As a
      rule, about three gallons of albumen will coat two reams of albumenized
      paper. Mr. England (to whom we are indebted for so many of our remarks
      on albumenizing paper) procures about the latter quantity at a time, and
      beats it up mechanically in a large vat holding some fifty gallons, in
      order to allow space for the froth. He allows the albumen to rest four
      days before employing it, and filters it through three thicknesses of
      flannel.
    </p>

    <p>
      The quality of paper to be used varies considerably with the custom of
      the printer. Thus, in some countries, we find a much thinner paper used
      than in England. The great desideratum is that it should be perfectly
      opaque to transmitted light. A good test of this is to make a couple of
      black ink marks on a piece of white paper, and then press down firmly
      the paper it is proposed to employ over this. If the black ink marks are
      indistinguishable, the paper will do as regards this quality, as the
      light reflected from the surface which gives the impression of whiteness
      to the eye is much stronger than the light which penetrates through it,
      and is absorbed by the black lines. As to quality, it is best to trust
      to the manufacturer, those known as Saxe and Rives papers answering
      better than any other that we know of. The Rives is, when moist, a paper
      which is more easily torn than the Saxe, and, consequently, we recommend
      that the former be employed for small work, such as portraits, and the
      latter for large landscape prints.
    </p>

    <p>
      In regard to the sizes to be albumenized, it must be left to the
      operator to say what will be the most useful to him. It is rarely
      advisable to albumenize less than a half sheet of paper, the whole size
      of which is about 22 by 18 inches; 11 by 18 is not an inconvenient
      size to manipulate. At any rate, a dish larger each way by a couple of
      inches than the paper must be procured, and put on a level table. The
      temperature of the room should be at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span> least 90°, in fact, the hotter
      it is the more glossy will be the resulting paper. The solution, free
      from bubbles, is poured in, and should be of a depth of at least <span class="frac"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span>
      an inch. Suppose the smaller size to be coated, before commencing, the
      paper is taken by the two opposite corners, the hands brought together,
      and the convex side brought on to the surface of the fluid; the hands
      are then separated, and the paper will gradually float on the surface.
      One corner should be gradually raised to see that all air-bubbles are
      absent. If there be any, they should be broken with the point of a glass
      rod, and the paper again lowered. Bubbles can usually be seen through
      the paper, and, instead of raising it, a few gentle taps with the finger
      over the spot will generally move the bubble to the edge of the paper.
      In practice, some have found it well to moisten the surface of the paper
      with a damp sponge, and when quite surface dry to albumenize it. This
      should, however, be unnecessary. The sheet should remain on the albumen
      a little over a minute, when it could be gently raised by one corner and
      allowed to drain over a basin; it is then caught by a couple of American
      clips and hung up to dry.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote-7" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 7">[7]</a>
    </p>

    <div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
      <img src="images/fig3.jpg" width="300" height="215" alt="" />
        <div class="caption"><i>Fig.</i> 3.</div>
    </div>

    <p>
      Supposing a whole sheet is to be coated, it will be found more
      convenient to take the sheet by the corners of <em>one end</em>, one in each
      hand, and to lower the surface near the end of the dish, and gradually
      draw the paper over the side of the dish till the whole surface is flat.
      Bubbles can be got rid of as shown above.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
      Two large dishes are usually employed, and by the time the second sheet
      is floated in the second dish, the first sheet of paper is ready for
      removal from the first dish. The sheets, when slowly removed from the
      bath, are allowed to drain a few seconds, and then thrown over wooden
      rods of some two inches in diameter, which are removed to a rack,
      and placed near a trough to collect the drainings.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote-8" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 8">[8]</a> When drained
      sufficiently the rods are removed to other racks, and the paper allowed
      to dry spontaneously.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is the practice of some albumenized paper manufacturers to hang the
      sheets over a line, uncoated side next to the line; but this is a mistake,
      as it will nearly always be found, on sensitising the paper and exposing
      it, that a mark is left across the paper corresponding to the part where
      the string touched the back of the paper.
    </p>

    <p>
      In practice we have found that each sheet of paper takes up about <span class="frac"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub></span>
      oz. of solution, and, of course, its equivalent quantity of salt. The
      principal difficulty in albumenizing paper is the occurrence of lines
      on the paper in the direction in which it was placed on the surface of
      the albumen. Any arrest of motion in floating the paper will cause them,
      but more usually it is due to imperfect beating up of the solution. Some
      papers are not readily coated with albumen, in which case the remedy
      given above may prove effectual; or a little solution of oxgall may be
      equally well applied. A want of gloss in the dried albumen may be due to
      too long a floating on the fluid, or to floating and drying the paper
      in too low a temperature. The explanation of the first cause is that
      albumen, when fresh, has an alkaline reaction, due to the presence of a
      small quantity of soda, which may be said to be its base, and any alkali
      will dissolve the gelatinous sizing of a paper. When the sizing is
      dissolved, instead of remaining on the surface, the albumen sinks into
      the paper, and thereby the gloss is lost.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
      When albumen is stale it no longer possesses this alkaline reaction, but
      has an acid reaction quite visible on the application of blue litmus
      paper to it; the blue colour disappears and is replaced by a red tint.
      When in the alkaline state, the paper is much more difficult to coat,
      but an acid condition means the production of inferior tones.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Rolling the Paper.</em>&mdash;The paper, when dried, is often rolled with a
      heavy pressure to improve the gloss; a copper-plate press is found
      to answer admirably, placing the albumenized side next the bed. This
      rolling should not be necessary if attention be paid to the temperature
      of the preparation room. The higher the temperature the finer will be
      the gloss, as we have already said.

    <small>THE SENSITIZING BATH FOR ALBUMENIZED PAPER.</small></h2>

    <p class="noi">
      <span class="smcap">To</span> render albumenized paper sensitive to light it has to be treated with
      a solution of silver nitrate, and the most convenient method of applying
      it is to float it on a dish containing the silver salt in solution. The
      first point to consider is the strength of the solution. If we float
      albumenized paper (face downwards) on a solution of 10 grains of silver
      nitrate to the ounce of water, we shall find, what at first sight may
      seem to be remarkable, that the albumen will be dissolved away from the
      paper, and that there will be a precipitate left in the silver solution.
      Why is this?
    </p>

    <p>
      It must be remembered that albumen is soluble in water: it is coagulated
      or insoluble in water when combined with silver nitrate. The fact
      is that the quantity of silver nitrate in the solution we have been
      experimenting with is too small. The water dissolves the albumen first,
      and then the silver has time to act upon it to form the insoluble
      albuminate. If we soak paper in common salt, and treat it in the same
      way with the same strength of solution, we shall find that this is not
      the case: the silver chloride will remain on the paper. From this we
      learn two facts.
    </p>

    <p>
      1st. That the silver solution has a greater affinity for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span> chloride
      than for the albuminate, and that in an equal mixture of the two more
      chloride would be formed than albuminate; in other words, that the
      ammonium chloride would be totally converted into silver chloride long
      before the silver albuminate was formed.
    </p>

    <p>
      2nd. That a certain strength of silver nitrate is necessary to prevent
      the albumen dissolving from off the paper.
    </p>

    <p>
      This last fact has fixed the lowest strength of any sensitizing solution
      to be thirty grains to the ounce, and even if this be taken as a limit,
      it is necessary that the water should be rendered less active by holding
      some other soluble matter in its embraces. This is usually effected by
      adding some other neutral and inactive nitrates. There does not seem
      to be any theoretical limit to <a name="the" id="the"></a><ins title="Added the">the</ins> amount of silver nitrate in
      solution, but practically it rarely contains more than 80 grains to the
      ounce, though occasionally we have heard of it being used of a strength
      of 100 grains to the ounce.
    </p>

    <p>
      The important point now presents itself. How are we to fix the strength
      of the bath? What principles must we follow?
    </p>

    <p>
      To answer these questions we extract a passage from another work of this
      series.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote-9" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 9">[9]</a>
    </p>

    <p>
      "If a paper be coated with albumen (say) in which has been dissolved
      a certain quantity of a soluble chloride, and floated on a silver
      solution, both chloride and albuminate of silver are formed. It depends,
      however, on the strength of the solution as to what proportions of each
      are present, owing to the fact that the organic compound is much slower
      in formation than the chloride, and has less affinity for the silver.
      If the silver solution be not sufficiently strong, the chloride may rob
      that portion of it with which it is in contact of all the silver before
      any (or, at all events, sufficient) albuminate has been formed, the
      molecule being composed almost entirely of silver chloride. The stronger
      the silver solution the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span> more 'organate' will it contain; whilst if it
      be very weak, very little will be present. Hence it is with albumenized
      paper which is weakly salted with a silver chloride a weak sensitizing
      bath may be used, whilst if it be rich in the chloride it must be of
      proportionate strength."
    </p>

    <p>
      It will now be seen that the proportion of chloride to albumen has
      to settle the point. We next have to consider the time during which
      the silver should be in contact with the paper when the floating is
      commenced. Let us take the case of a strong silver solution, and
      consider the action that will follow. Immediately the paper is placed in
      contact with the solution, silver chloride is formed, and the amount of
      the silver nitrate in the layer of fluid in immediate contact with the
      surface being scarcely diminished by the formation of silver chloride,
      the albuminate is formed almost simultaneously, forming a film which is
      to a great extent impermeable to the liquid. But even before this layer
      is coagulated, the next layer of chloride will have been formed, so that
      we may say we have one layer of albuminate and chloride of silver, and
      one layer of chloride of silver alone.
    </p>

    <p>
      The further penetration of the silver solution will be very slow; hence,
      for fully saturating both the albumen and the salt with silver, the time
      of flotation must be prolonged. For some purposes, however, this is not
      necessary, as will be seen presently.
    </p>

    <p>
      Next let us trace the action of a weak solution, not weak enough to
      dissolve the albumen off the paper, but of the minimum strength. The
      solution, as before, would immediately form the silver chloride, but
      before the albumen had coagulated at the surface, the solution would
      penetrate to the interior of the film, and then the formation of the
      albuminate would proceed nearly equally throughout the whole of the
      interior. Evidently, then, in this case, the contact of the silver
      solution would be less prolonged than in the former case. If the
      floating be prolonged the silver solution in the interior will become
      weakened, and partially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span> dissolve the albumen and be carried by the
      water into the interior of the paper; it will also partially dissolve
      off the surface, and a negative printed on such a paper would have all
      the appearance of being dead in lustre, and existing in the paper itself
      instead of on the surface.
    </p>

    <p>
      We may thus summarize:&mdash;
    </p>

    <p>
      1. A paper floated on a strong solution may require long floating.
    </p>

    <p>
      2. A paper floated on a weak solution requires short floating.
    </p>

    <p>
      3. And the strength of the solution may be between the 30 grains and
      80 grains to the ounce of silver according to the amount of soluble
      chloride dissolved in the albumen on the paper when the negative is
      really good as regards opacity and delicacy.
    </p>

    <p>
      The knowledge of the amount of chloride in the paper supplied by dealers
      has to be arrived at somehow, and the following method will answer. Cut
      up a quarter sheet of the paper into small pieces, and place them in a
      couple of ounces of methylated spirit. This will dissolve out most of
      the chloride, and should be decanted off. Another two ounces of spirit
      should be added to the paper, and, after thoroughly soaking, should be
      decanted off, and added to the other spirit. The spirit containing the
      chloride may then be placed in a glass vessel standing in hot water,
      when it will evaporate and leave the chloride behind. It may be weighed;
      but since it is better to know how much silver chloride (AgCl) would be
      formed, the residue should be dissolved in a few drops of water, and a
      little silver nitrate added. The silver chloride will be precipitated,
      and should be carefully washed with water, and then be filtered, the
      paper being opened out and dried before the fire on filter paper. The
      chloride is then detached and weighed; 3<span class="frac"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> grains of silver chloride
      would show that a weak bath should be used, whilst 10 grains would show
      that a strong bath was required.
    </p>

    <p>
      With most brands of albumenized paper directions are issued as to the
      best strength of silver nitrate solution for sensitizing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span> and a fair
      estimate of the chloride present can be gained from such directions.
    </p>

    <p>
      A weak solution loses much of its strength by each sheet of paper
      floated, much more proportionally, in fact, than a strong solution,
      since the same amount of fluid is absorbed by the paper in each case,
      whilst the amount of silver abstracted from the <em>whole</em> is also equal,
      which reduces the strength per ounce more with the former than with
      the latter. A weak sensitizing solution, therefore, requires much
      more attention than a strong one: crystals of silver nitrate must be
      constantly added to the former. In practice and for general work, then,
      we recommend a moderately strong bath, the method of making up of which
      we shall describe.
    </p>

    <p>
      To make up 2 pints of solution with a strength of 50 grains to the
      ounce, we shall require 2,000 grains of silver nitrate. This is
      carefully weighed out in the scales, a piece of <i>filter paper being
      placed in each pan</i>. By adopting this plan freedom from all impurities
      that may cling to the pans will be avoided, and the silver nitrate
      will be perfectly pure. Place the silver salt in a large clean bottle,
      and add half-a-pint of water to it, and shake it to dissolve it. The
      best water for the purpose is distilled water; but filtered rain, pure
      spring, or river water answers well. If the water contain any chlorides,
      it will be shown by a milkiness due to a formation of silver chloride.
      This must be filtered out when the remaining pint and a-half of water
      is added. The solution is now ready for use, and, being of the simplest
      character, is not to be excelled, though the addition of some soluble
      salts may be advantageous, particularly in dry climates or in very dry
      weather. Such salts are found in sodium nitrate, or ammonium nitrate, as
      much as equal weights of either of these substances being added. Thus
      our formula would stand as follows were these additions made:&mdash;

    <p>
      The reason of the addition of the ammonium or sodium nitrate is that
      prints are better obtained on paper which is not absolutely free from
      water. When very dry, the liberated chlorine (see <a href="#Page_32">page 32</a>) is apt
      to attack the albuminate, whereas it is deprived of much of its activity
      when it is able to be absorbed by water, which, in the presence of
      light, is decomposed into hydrochloric acid and oxygen.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote-10" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 10">[10]</a>
    </p>

    <p>
      Hydrochloric acid can attack the silver nitrate present in the pores
      of the paper, and produce fresh silver chloride. If the paper were
      quite dry, the liberated chlorine would scarcely be able to attack
      even the silver. Moisture, though very little, is desirable. In the
      excessively dry climate of India, &amp;c., in the summer, one or other of
      these deliquescent salts should be invariably present for the purpose
      indicated, unless fuming be resorted to.
    </p>

    <p>
      The sensitizing bath should also never be allowed to be acid with nitric
      acid, since the resulting prints would invariably be poor.
    </p>

    <p>
      The best way of securing this neutral state is by keeping a little
      carbonate of silver at the bottom of the bottle in which the solution is
      kept. A few drops of a solution of sodium carbonate added to the bottle
      over-night will secure this. The reason why nitric acid is to be avoided
      is shown by placing a print in dilute nitric acid. It is well known that
      darkened silver chloride is unaffected by it; but the print will be
      found to change colour, and to become duller and redder than if washed
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>in water alone. The nitric acid evidently attacks the albumen. Nitric
      acid decomposes the carbonate of silver (which, be it remembered, is an
      insoluble body), forming silver nitrate, and liberating carbonic acid.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote-11" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 11">[11]</a>
    </p>

    <p>
      Alum in the printing bath has also been recommended for preventing the
      bath from discolouring, and it is effective in that it hardens the
      surface of the albumen; but the ordinary explanation of its effect is
      defective. If a solution of common alum be added to the silver nitrate
      we get silver sulphate (which is best out of the bath, and it is
      slightly soluble in the solution), and aluminium nitrate is formed.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote-12" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 12">[12]</a>
    </p>

    <p>
      The same effect would be produced if aluminium nitrate were added to the
      bath solution. We, however, give a means of adding it as recommended by
      some writers. When filtering the solution, put a small lump of alum in
      the filter paper, and pour the solution over it, or add one grain of
      alum to every ounce of solution, and then filter.

    <small>HOW TO KEEP THE SENSITIZING BATH IN ORDER.</small></h2>

    <p class="noi">
      <span class="smcap">Experience</span> tells us, however strong we may make the bath solution to
      coagulate the albumen on the paper, that a certain amount of organic
      matter will always be carried into it. At first this is not apparent,
      since it remains colourless in the solution; but after a time, after
      floating a few sheets of paper, the organic silver compound gradually
      decomposes, and the solution becomes of a brown or red tint, and if
      paper were floated on it in this condition there would be a dark surface
      and uneven sensitizing. It is, therefore, necessary to indicate the
      various means that may be employed to get rid of this impurity. The
      earliest, if not one of the best, is by the addition of white China
      clay, which is known in commerce as kaolin. A teaspoonful is placed in
      the bottle containing the solution, and well shaken up; the organic
      matter adheres to it, and precipitates to the bottom, and the liquid can
      be filtered through filter-paper or washed cotton-wool, when it will
      be found decolourized. Another mode of getting the liquid out of the
      bottle is to syphon it off by any syphon arrangement, and this prevents
      a waste in the solution from the absorption of the filtering medium. The
      accompanying arrangement (<a href="#fig4">fig. 4</a>) will be found useful for the purpose,
      and can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
      be applied to other solutions where decantation is necessary. A
      is a wide-mouthed bottle holding the solution. B is a cork fitting the
      mouth, in which two holes have been bored to fit the two tubes, D and C,
      which are bent to the form shown. When the kaolin has subsided to the
      bottom, air is forced by the mouth into the bottle through C, the liquid
      rises over the bend of the tube D, and syphons off to the level of the
      bottom of the tube inserted into the liquid, provided the end of D,
      outside the bottle, comes below it.
    </p>

    </div>

    <p>
      To bend a tube, a common gas flame is superior to a Bunsen burner. The
      tube is placed in the bright part of the flame in the position shown; by
      this means a good length of it gets heated, and a gentle bend is made
      without choking the bore, which would be the case were a point of a
      flame used.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another method of purifying the solution is by adding a few drops of
      hydrochloric (muriatic) acid to it. Chloride of silver is formed, and
      when well shaken up, carries down with it most of the organic matter,
      but leaves the bath acid from the formation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span> of nitric acid.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote-13" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 13">[13]</a> This
      must be neutralized unless a little silver carbonate is left at the
      bottom of the bottle as described at <a href="#Page_20">page 20</a>. A camphor solution may
      also be added for the same purpose. Make a saturated solution of camphor
      in spirits of wine, and add a couple of drachms to the solution, and
      shake well up. The camphor will collect the albumen, and it can be
      filtered out. In case the first dose does not decolourize it, another
      one must be added.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another plan is to add potassium permanganate (permanganate of potash)
      to it, till such time as the solution takes a faint permanent rose
      tint. The theory is that the organic matter is oxidized by the oxygen
      liberated from the permanganate, and falls to the bottom. It is not
      strictly true, however, and the solution will never be as free from
      organic matter as when the other methods are employed.
    </p>

    <p>
      The final and best method is to add a small quantity of sodium carbonate
      (say 5 grains), and expose it to daylight. When the organic matter
      becomes oxidized at the expense of the silver nitrate, the metallic
      silver with the oxidized organic matter will fall to the bottom. This
      plan answers admirably when time is no object, but in dull weather the
      action is slow. When once the precipitation fairly commences it goes on
      quickly, and if a little freshly precipitated metallic silver be left at
      bottom of the bottle the action is much more rapid. This is a wrinkle
      worth remembering in all photographic operations where precipitation is
      resorted to.
    </p>

    <p>
      We have hitherto supposed that the only contamination of the bath is
      organic matter, but it must be borne in mind that each sheet of paper
      floated on the solution transfers a certain amount of nitrate of the
      alkali<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote-14" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 14">[14]</a> with which the albumen is salted.
    </p>



    <div class="figcenter" style="width: 165px;">
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
      <img src="images/fig6.jpg" width="165" height="300" alt="" />
        <div class="caption"><i>Fig.</i> 6.</div>
    </div>

    <p>
      It will thus be seen that in an old bath there will be no need to add
      the soluble nitrates given in <a href="#Page_17">page 17</a>, since they will be already
      formed. When they are in excess the best plan is to precipitate the
      silver by some means,<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote-15" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 15">[15]</a> but we select one which is easy of application,
      since it requires no watching. Evaporate the solution to half its
      bulk, and slightly acidify it with nitric acid (10 drops to the pint
      of solution will suffice); throw some ordinary granulated zinc into
      the jar or bottle containing it; the silver will now be rapidly thrown
      down in the metallic state, and in the course of two or three hours
      the action will be complete. Next carefully pour off all the fluid as
      close as possible to the residue. Pick out all the lumps of zinc, and
      add a little dilute hydrochloric acid to dissolve up all the small
      particles of zinc which may be amongst the precipitated silver. Filter
      the solution away, and wash the residue once or twice with water. Take
      out the filter paper, and dry it before a fire, or in an oven, and then
      detach the silver, and transfer it to a small crucible, which place,
      with its contents, over a Bunsen burner or spirit lamp flame till it is
      red hot. The heat will destroy all organic matter, leaving a residue of
      carbonous matter behind, which, after subsequent operations, will be
      eliminated by filtration. Next cover the silver with nitric acid,<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote-16" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 16">[16]</a>
      and in an evaporating dish slightly warm it over a spirit lamp or
      Bunsen burner. Red fumes will appear, and when all action has ceased,
      more acid must be added till such a time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span> that very nearly (but not
      quite) all the silver is dissolved up. Then evaporate off all the fluid
      and allow it to cool, when water can be added to such an extent that
      it is <em>over strength</em> for the bath. Now measure the whole bulk of the
      solution in a glass measure, and test by the argentometer for strength.
      An argentometer is, in reality, an instrument for taking the specific
      gravity of a liquid. It is as shown in the figure. A B is a glass tube,
      inside of which is a graduated scale showing grains; C is a hollow
      glass cylinder, which has a little glass ball filled with mercury. When
      immersed in water, the instrument sinks till the scale reads 0&mdash;that
      is, A B is deeply immersed. When any soluble salt is dissolved in the
      water, the stem rises further. If the soluble salt be silver nitrate,
      the scale is made to read grains per ounce. It is then evident, if the
      bath contains any other soluble salt besides the nitrate of silver, the
      readings will be untrustworthy. Supposing you have a total quantity of
      10<span class="frac"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub></span> ounces of solution, and the argentometer tells you it is of a
      strength of 105 grains to the ounce, you must make a small calculation
      to see how much water you must add. In 10<span class="frac"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub></span>ounces of solution there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
      will be 10<span class="frac"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub></span> × 105 or 1076<span class="frac"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub></span> grains of silver nitrate. If you want
      to make the bath 40 grains to the ounce, you must divide this quantity
      by 40, which is very nearly 27. The original amount of fluid (10<span class="frac"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub></span>
      ounces), when deducted from this number of (27) ounces, will give you
      the amount (16<span class="frac"><sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub></span> ounces) of water that is to be added to give you a
      bath of the required strength. When the water is added, the solution
      should be filtered from the carbonaceous matter, and the bath, after
      neutralizing with sodium carbonate, will be ready for use.

    <small>APPLYING THE SILVERING SOLUTION TO THE ALBUMENIZED PAPER.</small></h2>

    <p class="noi">
      <span class="smcap">As</span> each piece of paper takes somewhere about five minutes to sensitize
      and hang up to dry, it is evident that the larger the piece of paper
      sensitised the greater will be the saving in time in this operation.
      Practically a whole sheet of paper, which is about 22 inches by 18, is
      the maximum ordinary size, whilst it may be convenient to float a piece
      as small as 3<span class="frac"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub></span> by 4<span class="frac"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub></span>. There is not much difficulty in floating
      either one or the other if ordinary care be taken, but it is no use
      disguising the fact that large sheets are sometimes faultily sensitized
      even by experienced hands, if the solution be not in a proper state. The
      great enemy to success is the formation of bubbles on the surface of the
      solution, and if it be at all contaminated with organic matter they are
      more liable to be met with than if the bath be new. It may be taken as a
      maxim that no paper should be floated if, to commence with, the bath be
      not purified. A flat dish of about 2<span class="frac"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span>inches in height, and an inch
      larger in breadth and length than the paper to be floated, is used, and
      the solution poured in to a depth of <span class="frac"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> inch. The paper is grasped by
      the two hands as shown at <a href="#Page_10">page 10</a>, so that a convex albumen surface is
      formed downwards, which is placed diagonally across the dish and lowered
      on to the surface of the solution; the hands are at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span> same time
      separated outwards, so that the whole surface of the paper is caused
      to float on it without any arrest. By this means all air is forced out
      before the paper, and no bubbles should be beneath. To make assurance
      double sure, the paper is raised from the corners which were not grasped
      by the hands, and if by any chance a small bubble should be found, it
      is immediately broken by the point of a clean quill pen or glass rod.
      Before floating the paper the surface of the solution should be examined
      for scum or bubbles, both of which may be removed by passing a strip of
      clean blotting-paper across it. The dish employed should be scrupulously
      clean, and in cold weather it is a good plan to warm both it and the
      solution before the fire previous to use. In warm weather, the albumen
      of the paper may be in a very horny condition, which increases the
      liability to form bubbles. The writers have found that if the sheet of
      paper be exposed to the steam passing from a kettle of boiling water for
      a few seconds (moving it so that every portion shall come in contact
      with it) just before sensitising, the surface becomes more tractable,
      and in a better condition for sensitizing; keeping the paper in a moist
      atmosphere effects the same end.
    </p>

    <p>
      The length of time for floating the paper depends on the subjects to be
      printed, <em>but, as a rule</em>, three minutes with the 50-grain bath will be
      found to answer for the majority of negatives. When the proper time has
      elapsed, a corner of the paper is raised from the solution by means of a
      glass rod, and grasped by the thumb and forefinger of the right hand. It
      is then raised <em>very slowly</em> from off the solution till another corner
      is clear, when that is grasped by the forefinger and thumb of the left
      hand; and it is finally withdrawn entirely, and drained a minute from
      the lowest corner into the dish. It is next hung up to dry by a corner
      which should be fastened to an American clip (<a href="#fig7">fig. 7</a>) suspended
      from a line stretched across the dark room, taking care to keep the
      corner which last left the solution the lowest. A piece of <em>clean</em>
      blotting-paper about one inch long by <span class="frac"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> an inch wide is brought in
      contact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span> with this latter corner, and adheres to it from the moisture.
      This collects the draining from the paper whilst drying, and prevents a
      loss of silver, since it can subsequently be detached and placed amongst
      the residues for burning.

    </div>

    <p>
      There is another mode of floating large sheets of paper, which is
      sometimes recommended. One corner is turned up about a quarter of an
      inch. This is held by the forefinger and thumb of the left hand, and the
      opposite corner of the diagonal held by the right hand. The first corner
      is brought on the solution near the opposite corner of the dish to that
      towards which it will eventually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span> be near. The sheet, having assumed a
      convex form, is drawn by the left hand across the dish, the right hand
      being gradually turned to allow the whole surface to come slowly in
      contact with the solution. Air-bubbles are said to be avoided by this
      means, though for our own part we see no practical advantage in it over
      the last method.

    </div>

    <p>
      Some operators also, when lifting the paper from the dish, pass it
      over a glass rod placed as in the figure, in order to get rid of all
      superfluous fluid from the surface. This is a poor substitute for
      withdrawing the paper slowly from the dish, since capillary attraction
      is much more effective and even in its action than this rude mechanical
      means. By those who do not possess patience, however, it may be tried.
      Some practical photographers also "blot off" the excess of silver,
      but this is a dangerous practice unless there is a certainty that no
      "anti-chlor" has been used in preparing the blotting-paper. For our own
      part we recommend the usual mode of draining the paper. When surface
      dry, it can be dried in a drying box. The following is a kind which has
      been adopted by one eminent photographer, and is excellent in principle.

    <small>WASHED SENSITIVE PAPER.</small></h2>

    <p class="noi">
      <span class="smcap">For</span> some classes of work sensitized paper may be washed with advantage
      previous to drying, and there is much economy in this plan, particularly
      in hot weather, since it keeps of a purer white for a much longer
      period than where the silver nitrate is allowed to dry on the surface.
      It may not be out of place to call attention to the action of silver
      nitrate on the paper. If a stick of lunar caustic be applied to the
      skin when dried, there is a peculiar burning effect produced, and even
      in the dark the cuticle becomes discoloured, though not black. In the
      albumenized paper we have albumen and the gelatine sizing, and these
      substances behave somewhat like the skin. The gelatine particularly will
      become oxidized at the expense of the silver, a reddish organic oxide
      being formed; and again, if the silver nitrate be alkaline or strictly
      neutral, we have the same action occurring as when we precipitate
      metallic silver by means of an alkali, and an organic body such as sugar
      of milk. The gelatine takes the place of the latter. When the free
      silver nitrate is removed, the tendency for the spontaneous darkening
      of the paper is much diminished, since the chloride and albuminate of
      silver are much less readily reduced than the nitrate. The following
      plan is adopted for washing the paper:&mdash;The paper, after floating,
      is drawn twice rapidly through a dish of rain or distilled water,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
      and, unless some other substance which can absorb chlorine be added
      to the last wash water, care should be taken not to soak out all the
      free nitrate, as then the paper would produce flat prints. It is then
      hung up to dry as before. Immediately before use it must be fumed with
      ammonia, in order that the prints may be "plucky," and free from that
      peculiar speckiness of surface which is known to the silver printer as
      "measles." We can readily trace the "measles" to their source. Suppose
      all free silver nitrate is washed away, and the paper be then exposed to
      light, the chloride is rapidly converted into subchloride, and chlorine
      is given off (see <a href="#Page_5">page 5</a>); if there be nothing to absorb it at once it
      will attack the albuminate, which is blackened at the same time, and
      fresh chloride will be formed in little minute spots. These discolour,
      and are of different tint to the rest of the print, and give rise to
      the appearance of measles. This, of course, is not so marked when a
      little free silver nitrate is left in the paper; but as what is removed
      is principally removed from the surface, it may still be unpleasantly
      discernible. Fuming obviates it entirely if properly performed, for
      chlorine and ammonia combine to form finally ammonium chloride, a
      neutral and inactive salt.
    </p>

    <p>
      Any other chlorine absorber may be substituted; thus citric acid,
      potassium nitrite, and many others are effective, and cause vigorous
      prints to be produced. Perhaps the easiest way of giving the paper the
      necessary amount of ammonia is that recommended by Colonel Wortley. This
      is to place overnight the pads of the printing-frame, if they be of
      felt, into a closed box in which is placed a saucer containing a couple
      of drachms of liquor ammoniæ, and to withdraw them as required for the
      printing-frames. The pads will be thoroughly impregnated with the vapour
      of ammonia, and a couple or more prints, in succession, may be made
      before it is necessary to change them.
    </p>

    <p>
      The ordinary method of fuming is that used in America. Hearn describes
      a box, which is very convenient and simple in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span> construction. He says:
      "Take any common wooden box, large enough for the purpose, and make a
      door of suitable size for it, which, when shut, will totally exclude
      all light. Make a false bottom in this about six inches, or so, from
      the real one, and perforate it with holes of about the same size that
      a gimlet would make. These holes should be very numerous, and at the
      centre there should be, if anything, a smaller number of them, because
      the saucer containing the liquor ammonia is generally placed at the
      centre of the real bottom of the box."
    </p>

    <p>
      For our own part we dislike the false bottom as constructed, and
      recommend one of fine gauze, and, instead of placing half-an-ounce of
      ammonia in the saucer as Hearn directs, we prefer to soak half-a-dozen
      sheets of blotting-paper in ammonium chloride solution, about 20 grains
      to the ounce, and the same number of sheets soaked in lime water; one
      sheet of each are placed together, and ammonia is liberated by double
      decomposition; calcium chloride being also formed.
    </p>

    <p>
      This method is excellent in hot, dry weather, since it imparts a certain
      amount of moisture to the paper. In damp weather it is a good plan to
      dry the vapour by sprinkling on the gauze calcium chloride, which will
      rapidly absorb the aqueous vapour, and will allow the ammonia to pass
      on unimpeded. The sheets of paper are held at the top of the box by
      American clips, suspended from laths about three inches apart, and it
      is not a bad plan to fasten a lath on to their bottom edge by the same
      means, to do away with their curling. To fume a single piece of paper
      it may be pinned up to the inside of the top of the lid of a box, and a
      drachm of ammonia sprinkled on cotton wool distributed at the bottom.
      The point to be attended to is that the fuming shall be even, and it is
      evident that the ammonia should rise equally from any part of the bottom
      of the box. In the plan of the box given above, the bottom of the sheet
      is apt to get a little more ammonia than the top. The time of fuming
      depends on so many things that a rule can scarcely be given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span> for it;
      twenty minutes may be considered about the extreme limit.
    </p>

    <p>
      If this sensitizing bath be acid, the time must evidently be longer than
      when it is strictly neutral or slightly alkaline; and if the negative be
      hard, it will require to be less fumed than if it be of a weak nature,
      since the action of ammonia is to cause rapid darkening in the deep
      shadows. In hot weather the fuming should be shorter than in cold, since
      the ammonia volatilizes much more rapidly when the temperature is high.
      On the whole, we recommend Colonel Wortley's plan of fuming the pads in
      preference to fuming the paper.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another mode of preserving the paper from discolouration is to add
      citric acid to the printing bath, which is effective owing to the fact
      given at <a href="#Page_32">page 32</a>. The following formula is a good one, and has answered
      with the writer. It is&mdash;

    <p>
      The paper is floated for the ordinary length of time, when it is dried
      thoroughly and placed between sheets of pure blotting-paper. It will
      keep in its pristine state for months, if excluded from the air. It is
      better to fume this paper strongly before use, or the toning becomes a
      difficult matter.

    <p>
      Ordinary sensitized paper may be preserved for a considerable time if,

      In the <span class="smcap">Year-Book of Photography</span> for 1880 Mr. A. Borland
      recommends the following modification:&mdash;
    </p>

    <p>
      He floats the paper on nitrate of silver, as usual, and after it has
      drained surface dry, blots off any drops that may remain at the edges,
      and then floats the <em>back</em> of the paper for about three minutes on the
      following bath:&mdash;
    </p>

    <table summary="Weight" class="weight">

        <td>Nitrate of soda</td>

      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
      This is rendered slightly acid by a little solution of <em>freshly</em>
      prepared citric acid in water. The degree of acidity is regulated by
      litmus paper (the blue specimen), which should be slightly reddened
      by it. After this solution has been mixed about ten minutes, it is
      filtered, and the paper floated. Mr. Borland says the paper keeps well,
      and prints the same as ordinary paper, and any tone may be produced.

    <small>CUTTING PAPER.</small></h2>

    <p class="noi">
      <span class="smcap">We</span> have often come across operators who have no really definite plan on
      which they cut up their paper for a day's work, and they have little
      idea of the most economical place of dividing the sheets. The following
      remarks by Mr. Hearn, which appeared in the <span class="smcap">Photographic News</span>,
      1874, will be useful to the printer, and, being so extremely well
      described, we take the liberty of reproducing them.
    </p>

    <p>
      "In cutting up the paper for printing, due regard should be given to
      the materials employed. In the first place, the fingers should be free
      from anything that will stain or soil the paper, and they should never
      touch the <em>silvered</em> side, but always the <em>back</em>. The hands should be
      perfectly dry, free even from any perspiration, for if this is not
      strictly regarded in the handling of the paper, 'finger stains' will
      appear on those parts of the paper with which the fingers come in
      contact. To guard against this, a rough towel should be suspended in a
      convenient place, and the hands wiped upon it as often as may be found
      necessary&mdash;say once in every five or ten minutes. An ivory newspaper
      cutter, about eight inches long and an inch wide, together with a
      suitable sized pair of shears, will be all of the instruments necessary.
    </p>

    <p>
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
      "In cutting the paper for very large prints, such as 13 by 16, 14 by 18,
      16 by 20, &amp;c., the beginner had best (to obtain the right size) lay over
      the sensitive paper the proper sized mat that is to be placed over the
      print when finished, and then cut accordingly. Considerable paper can be
      saved in this way, and printed in card size.
    </p>

    <p>
      "There should always be an assortment of different sized mats in the
      printing room; one of each size will do, which should be kept expressly
      for this purpose.
    </p>

    <p>
      "In cutting the paper for an 11 by 14 print, the length of the sheet
      is generally placed before the printer, and the paper bent over to the
      further edge of the sheet, and then creased, and thus cut into two equal
      pieces, one of which can be used for the contemplated print. I would
      recommend that instead of taking exactly one half of the sheet of paper,
      as described above, to take about <em>an inch more</em> than the half, so as to
      allow for any slight tear that may happen along the edges of the paper
      during the washing, toning, &amp;c., and also so as to be sure of having the
      paper wide enough for the different sized mats.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I have seen some nice prints printed upon the exact half of a sheet of
      paper, which, when taken from the final washing (and the edges trimmed,
      being slightly torn), were then too narrow to be covered with the proper
      sized mats, and had to be rejected; whereas, if in cutting this paper
      allowance had been made for this final trimming, the prints would have
      been saved. The rest of the sheet can be cut very well into sixteen or
      eighteen carte pieces.
    </p>

    <p>
      "In cutting cabinets out of a sheet, fifteen is all that can very well
      be obtained, and to get that number lay the sheet on a wide table, or
      printing bench (with the length of it running from right to left), and
      divide it into three equal parts. By laying the cabinet glass on these
      strips of paper, and cutting the paper a little wider than the glass,
      five cabinets can be obtained from each strip, and fifteen out of the
      whole. These pieces will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span> plenty large enough, both in length and
      width; besides, this is a very convenient and economical way to cut the
      paper without waste.

      pieces will be 4<span class="frac"><sup>2</sup>/<sub>5</sub></span> by 6 inches, and consequently there will be more
      room for the width than there will be for the length. The edges of the
      width side of the paper can be trimmed a little, as there is usually
      some little tear, or some other defect, that can thus advantageously be
      got rid of. Often, when there are only a few cabinets to be printed,
      I take a quarter-sheet, and bend over the length of it to about
      three-quarters of an inch of the opposite side, crease it, and then
      cut with the paper-knife. You thus obtain a large and small piece; the
      smaller one of these can be cut into four cards, and the larger one
      can be cut in two, and thus obtain two generous size cabinets; or the
      printer can use the larger of the two pieces for printing the 4 by 4
      size. This is the way I obtain my 4 by 4 pieces when I wish them.

      "In making out the above, I have considered the sheet of paper to be 18
      by 22 inches in size, but it is seldom that the sheet measures <em>exactly</em>
      this, for the <em>length</em> often measures from one quarter to one inch more,
      but never less, while the width is invariably the same. When this is the
      case, a little better margin is allowed in cutting the sheet up, which
      is a good thing, especially when a large number of small pieces are
      to be obtained from the sheet. Forty-two pieces is all that should be
      obtained from a sheet of paper which measures 18 by 22 (or 18 by 22<span class="frac"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span>,

      should be with safe results to the prints, on account of bad edges, &amp;c.,
      which it is often necessary to trim after printing. There is a way to
      obtain forty-eight, and even fifty-two pieces of paper from the sheet,
      but I would not advise any of my readers to try to obtain that quantity,
      as there are many disadvantages connected with it that more than
      neutralize the benefits. The paper is sometimes cut up to the <i>exact
      carte size</i>, and then printed up as it is, thus saving the trimming of
      the prints after printing. This is, perhaps (?), a good way, but for
      the beginner it is very risky, because the paper will have to be placed
      <em>exactly on the negative</em>, or else the print will be worthless. Even to
      the experienced printer this is very difficult, because the greatest
      care and skill are required to do it <em>as it should be done</em>; then the

      <span class="smcap">There</span> are a variety of printing-frames in the market, each of which may
      have something to recommend it; and yet, as a rule, the simpler and
      more uniform the frames are, the more handy are they for the printer,
      since he rapidly becomes accustomed to handling them, and knows their
      peculiarities. The simplest pattern is one introduced by Meagher, as
      shown in <a href="#fig16">fig. 16</a>. The negative rests on india-rubber strips which line
      a framework of its exact size, and a folding back, as shown, covers
      it. The paper is pressed on to the negative by a pad, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span> back on
      that by means of two brass springs. This is a very excellent pattern
      for cabinet pictures and cartes, but we can scarcely recommend it for
      anything larger, since even if it were possible to supply sufficient
      pressure to secure proper contact of the paper, the negative would be in
      danger of being cracked.
    </p>

    <p>
      For all sizes above cabinet, the printing frame as given in the figure
      is the best. The construction will be seen at once. In the front part of
      the frame is a piece of thick plate glass (depending for its thickness
      on the size of the frame). On this the negative rests, and over this
      again are the necessary pads and backboard, which is clamped down by
      means of two cross-bars, on which springs are fixed. An increase of
      pressure may be given by increasing the thickness of the pad (which
      may consist of smooth felt) next the negative, or by sheets of thick
      blotting-paper quite free from all folding marks.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sometimes the back of the frame is hinged in three pieces,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote-18" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 18">[18]</a> and this
      is almost essential for large prints (say 2 feet by 1 foot 6 inches),
      since every part of the picture should be capable of examination during
      the progress in printing. With a simple single hinged backboard this is
      impossible.

      When large negatives are to be printed, the plate glass front should
      always have at least an inch clear all round. For smaller negatives
      (say 12 by 10 and under) half-an-inch clear is sufficient. This allows
      a certain latitude in the position of the negative, and enables the
      fingers to get at the paper without inconvenience. In the frames in
      which the front of the negative is unsupported this cannot be the
      case, and for this reason (as well as those given above) they are not
      recommended for large prints.

    <small>PREPARING A LANDSCAPE NEGATIVE FOR PRINTING.</small></h2>

    <p class="noi">
      <span class="smcap">Landscape</span> negatives are rarely ever in perfect harmony for printing,
      and much may be done by judicious doctoring of the best of negatives
      to secure the best of prints. With moderate negatives it is absolutely
      essential that they should be improved. Let us take the example of a
      hard landscape negative, which if printed so that the deep shades should
      show detail, would show none in the high lights.
    </p>

    <p>
      A piece of thin tissue paper (the kind known as <em>papier minerale</em> is
      the best), of the size of the negative, is damped evenly with a sponge,
      and carefully pasted on the back of the negative. The negative is then
      held up to the light, and the high lights carefully traced with a faint
      line by means of a pencil. These are then cut out by means of a sharp
      penknife, and a trial print taken in the shade. If it be found that
      the shadows still print too deeply when the detail in the high light
      is visible, another thickness of tissue paper may be applied, cutting
      out this time, perhaps, the high lights and the half tones. Another
      trial print will show whether the object is attained. If still not
      satisfactory, crayon in powder from the scrapings of a stick of crayon,
      or blacklead, may be applied by a stump to the parts requiring it. It
      may happen that the effects of the tissue paper may be seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span> in the
      print by the light penetrating beneath it, and causing the edges of
      the shadows to print too dark. In this case, which may arise from the
      negative being taken on a thin glass plate, the parts covering the high
      lights, and which were cut out, should be indented with a jagged edge
      such as this, the dotted line showing where the cut would come if it had
      been cut out in a clean sharp line. Another mode which we have sometimes
      found successful, though care is required in employing it, is to coat
      the back of the plate with a very dilute emulsion of a quarter the
      ordinary consistency, <a name="then" id="then"></a><ins title="Original has than">then</ins> to expose it, through the negative,
      and develop with one of the ordinary alkaline developers (we prefer the
      ferrous oxalate),<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote-19" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 19">[19]</a> and then fix. This last film may be protected with
      a layer of albumen 1 part of albumen to 25 parts of water. By this means
      the shadows become subdued and the contrasts diminished, and there is no
      danger of any sharp demarcations in the shades being apparent.
    </p>

    <div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">

        <div class="caption"><ins title="Retained original figure number"><i>Fig.</i> 16.</ins></div>
    </div>

    <p>
      There is one way of improving a hard negative, if taken on a gelatine
      plate, which would probably be dangerous in the hands of a novice, but
      which is most effective when used with skill and judgment, but must be
      applied before the plate is varnished. One of the most popular methods
      of reducing the density of an over-intensified gelatine negative is with
      a very weak solution of perchloride of iron. The writers have found that
      the reducing agent may be applied locally. Let us suppose the case of a
      figure in a landscape in a light dress, which produces a white patch in
      the print. The negative should be placed in a dish of water, then lifted
      up until the part to be reduced <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>is just above the level of the water;
      a solution of perchloride of iron should then be applied to the part
      with a camel's-hair pencil, care being taken that it does not spread
      over the edges or run down the negative. When this is found to be taking
      place, the plate should be allowed to fall into the water; it can then
      be lifted again, and the operation proceeded with. It is not easy to
      give any strength for the solution of perchloride of iron, but it is
      best to begin weak, and strengthen as required. A saturated solution has
      been used in an obstinate case without any mischief being done, but this
      required very careful watching.
    </p>

    <p>
      For landscapes, Mr. England has successfully used a strong solution
      of cyanide of potassium with the same object. He moistens the parts
      of the gelatine plates which require reduction with water applied by
      a paint-brush, and afterwards, with another, applies the cyanide. The
      reduction can be watched as it progresses, and by a judicious use of the
      brush no sharp line of demarcation between the reduced and unaltered
      parts is visible.
    </p>

    <p>
      With a thin negative the tissue paper may be applied as before, only
      in this case the shadows are left bare, the half tones have one
      thickness of tissue paper over them, the highest lights two or three. An
      emulsion may be used in this case as well, only instead of fixing the
      transparency which is at the back, the precipitated silver is dissolved
      away by nitric acid, and the developer applied again. By this means,
      the density in the high lights may be doubled if required. It must
      again be repeated, that in all cases the use of emulsion requires great
      care, seeing that if any get on the varnished surface, markings are
      sure to occur. It sometimes happens, especially with gelatine plates,
      that the corners of one side of a negative print too dark. This is very
      visible in sky and sea pictures. The careful application of blacklead
      on the tissue paper on the back of the plate may often save a beautiful
      negative that would be otherwise useless.
    </p>

    <p>
      In most landscape negatives there is a want of atmosphere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span> (by which
      we mean the haze always present in the air) in the distance and middle
      distances, and we have found that by applying one piece of tissue-paper
      to the back of the negative to cover the middle distance and distances,
      and another to cover the distance alone, atmospheric effect is produced.
      The effect of atmosphere is usually shown by grey tones as compared
      with those of the foreground, and the greyer they are the more distant
      should the objects be away in nature. This effect is accomplished by the
      tissue-paper. It must, however, be remembered that the lights of distant
      objects are greyer than those of the foreground, hence the tissue paper
      must be used with judgment to prevent the distant lights from appearing
      too white. This sometimes is effected by giving <i>the lights in the
      foreground</i> a covering of tissue paper. We very much doubt if there
      exists any landscape negative which would not be improved by the use of
      tissue paper, since photography often tends to do away with atmosphere.
      We have, in some cases, strengthened the high lights on the film side
      with the paint-brush and Prussian blue. This requires skill, and should
      be done very sparingly. It may be objected that when these artifices
      are resorted to, that the photograph must of necessity fail in regard
      to truthfulness. The answer to this objection is quite easy to give.
      If a photograph were true in itself, they should never be resorted to,
      but since it always falls short of the truth, it is quite legitimate to
      give it the effect that a perfect process would do, by which we mean one
      in which the intensity of the negative is exactly proportional to the
      intensity of the light producing it.
    </p>

    <p>
      It has been shown in the <span class="smcap">Photographic News</span> of 1877, that the
      gradations of a negative are never perfect, and the use of the tissue
      paper, &amp;c., makes it more nearly in accord with nature.
    </p>

    <p>
      These remarks, of course, have reference only to what we might call "a
      good printing negative;" the advisability of doctoring poor negatives
      is scarcely open to argument. Improve as much as you like, but be very
      careful not to overdo it.

    <small>PRINTING THE LANDSCAPE PICTURE.</small></h2>

    <p class="noi">
      <span class="smcap">A trial</span> print from a negative should first of all be taken, to enable
      the operator to <a name="gauge" id="gauge"></a><ins title="Original has guage">gauge</ins> as to how much is required to be
      done to it. A piece of sensitized paper of the exact size of the plate
      is taken and examined by transmitted light in the dark room. If there
      be any appearance of markings due to bubbles, or of star-like metallic
      spots, probably due to small particles of iron being in the albumen, it
      need not be rejected altogether. Should there be any of these defects,
      the sheet should be placed on one side to cut up into smaller sizes. We
      will suppose that we are going to print a 15 by 12 negative. A strong
      frame (of the description given at <a href="#Page_44">page 44</a>) must be employed, and the
      thick plate glass carefully freed from all dust, grit, or stains.
      The back of the negative is then placed in contact with it, so as to
      occupy the centre of the frame. The piece of sensitive paper is placed
      over it, and the back placed loosely over it, and is then carried face
      downward into the place where the printing is to be done, and the frame
      is placed face downwards on the floor, and left for a few minutes.
      By this artifice the paper takes the same degree of humidity as the
      atmosphere, and there will be no danger of any cockling, and consequent
      (as it is termed) want of contact, between the paper and the negative.
      This is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
      only necessary when there is any very great difference in the
      temperature of the drying room and the place where the prints are to be
      exposed, and in some establishments the difficulty is met by carrying
      the whole supply of paper in a closed box into the latter place, and
      allowing it to absorb any moisture that it can take up. In any case,
      the paper is next to be placed in absolute contact with the negative,
      and we strongly recommend the use of sheets of blotting-paper cut to
      the proper size (about four thicknesses will be sufficient), and backed
      by a thick pad of closely woven and very smooth felt. These latter are
      rather expensive, but are very durable if ordinary care be taken of
      them. The blotting-paper is useful in causing contact, and also because
      any accidental presence of silver nitrate solution on the back of the
      sensitive paper is immediately detected, and there is, consequently, no
      danger of carrying it to another print and spoiling it, which it might
      do were it absorbed by the felt pad.
    </p>

    <p>
      The back of the frame is then placed <em>in situ</em>, and the hinged
      cross-piece brought down and secured by the fasteners. If the springs be
      sufficiently strong, the film of the negative should now be in absolute
      contact with the sensitive paper. If there be any grit on the plate
      glass, or adhering to the back of the negative, it is highly probable
      that the glass plate will crack, and if the plate on which the negative
      is taken be very curved,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote-20" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 20">[20]</a> the same disaster may be expected. Suppose
      the day to be bright, and the negative fairly dense, the frame may
      be placed for the trial print facing away from the sun (if there be
      any) so that it receives merely skylight, and no direct rays. When the
      transparent parts of the negative seem to have taken a fairly black or
      brown colour, the print should be examined. In practice we have found
      (supposing the printing room be away from the dark room) that a cloth of
      thin yellow calico is a useful <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
      adjunct during the examination. The cloth is large
      enough to cover the frame and also the head of the operator. One half
      of the back is loosened and raised, the half pieces are pulled back,
      and the paper will probably be found adhering to the negative, and may
      require a little man&oelig;uvring to separate it. A very thin slip (of
      the size of a toothpick) of soft wood, sharpened at one end, is a good
      implement to employ, as by inserting it the paper can be separated
      at one corner, and then be raised by the fingers. We have seen some
      printers blow against the paper, as if they were separating the leaves
      of a book from one another, but this method is to be deprecated, since
      particles of saliva are apt to be carried on to the paper with the
      breath, and to cause spots, which often appear unaccountable. Should
      the print appear slightly deeper than it is required to remain, it
      is probably ready to be withdrawn from the action of light, but the
      remaining half of the paper must next be examined to see whether such is
      the case. To do this the first half of the pressure-board of the frame
      which is loose must be pressed down once more into position, the frame
      reversed end for end, and the other half of the board opened.
    </p>

    <p>
      If the print is large (say 15 by 12) it is not advisable to look at much
      of it at once, or for a longer time than can be avoided. It constantly
      happens that on a warm day the paper contracts during the short time
      necessary for a proper examination of the print; the consequence is,
      that the paper does not fall on the same place on the negative when
      reflected, and the result is a double print on the paper.
    </p>

    <p>
      The printing being judged to be complete, the paper is withdrawn by
      taking off pressure-board and pads, and put away for the further
      operations of toning and fixing. In one establishment we are acquainted
      with, the prints when taken from the frame are placed in a box the lid
      of which is pierced by a hole covered with a dark cloth; whilst others
      keep them in a press of blotting-paper. The great point to attend to,
      however, is to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span> keep them away from all actinic light; and we should
      say, further, from all light, since darkened silver chloride becomes
      oxidized in light which is usually considered to be non-actinic.
      No doubt every printer is aware that the prints produced from the
      same negative and on the same sample of albumenised paper similarly
      sensitized vary considerably in richness and depth on different days.
      For instance, when the light is bad, and when, consequently, the
      printing takes a long time, the colour of the darkened surface will
      be found to be much duller than on a day when the light is powerful.
      Silver albuminate is much less sensitive to feeble light, whilst in
      bright light the difference in sensitiveness is not nearly so marked,
      and this may account in a certain degree for the difference; but if any
      one takes the trouble to expose sensitised albumenized paper to bright
      light so as to darken, and then to cover up half, leaving the other half
      to be exposed to the light coming through ruby-glass, it will be found
      that there is a difference in colour between the two portions, and on
      toning the differences will be still more marked. In dull weather the
      red and yellow rays bear a greater proportion to the blue and violet
      rays (all of which enter into the composition of white light) than
      they do on a bright day. It is the blue and violet rays that reduce
      the silver chloride to the state of sub-chloride, and then oxidize the
      latter; yet it must be remembered that the red and yellow also oxidize
      the sub-chloride without being able primarily to produce it. Hence on
      a bright day, when the printing is quick, the red and yellow rays have
      but little time to do any work, whilst on a dull day they have plenty
      of opportunity of oxidizing the sub-chloride as fast as it is formed.
      The oxidized image is always more difficult to tone than one which is
      unoxidized, hence the advantage of printing in a good light if possible.
      The writers believe that one of the principal causes of the variation in
      tone of silver prints, which is only too often to be seen, is caused by
      this difference in length of exposure to the light.

    <p>
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
      The operator must now be supposed to be cognizant of the operations of
      toning and fixing which are to be described in subsequent chapters,
      and that he has the finished trial print of the particular landscape
      negative before him. He sees whether the middle distance or far
      distance is obtrusive, and notes which portions require to be softened
      down by tissue paper, or to be brought nearer by strengthening the
      high-lights, and eventually forms a picture of it as it should be,
      <a name="centring" id="centring"></a><ins title="Original has centreing">centring</ins> his imagination in it as built up round the point
      of principal interest. He endeavours to see whether the sweeps of light
      and shade lead up to this principal object in the view, and whether, if
      light, it is in contrast with an immediate dark part of the picture, or
      <em>vice versa</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Knowing that this is one of the laws of art, he next should endeavour
      practically to give effect to his imaginative picture by the judicious
      manipulation of tissue paper, the crayon, and the paint, such as
      described in <a href="#ix">Chapter IX.</a> The next point to attend to is as to whether
      the picture requires clouds or not, and if he have a stock of cloud
      negatives of the right size, he must endeavour to pick out one, a
      portion of which will compose well with the lines of the picture,<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote-21" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 21">[21]</a>
      and at the same time be correct as regards light and shade. When such
      a negative is selected, it remains to print it in. A white sky is an
      abomination, and a plain tinted one without gradation is nearly as bad.
      If, therefore, the operator has the heart and means to do this double
      printing, he should never neglect to do it.
    </p>

    <p>
      But we would here remind him that when a sky-negative has been used
      with a particular view, it should always be devoted to that landscape.
      Nothing could be in worse taste, or further from nature, than to use
      the same sky with different landscapes. We once saw a frame of sixteen
      views, thirteen of which were backed with the same sky; this was bad
      enough, but the absurdity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span> went further, and in the same exhibition were
      landscapes by another photographer with the same sky! The inference is
      that both these photographers bought their sky negatives, printed them,
      and exhibited them as their own&mdash;a proceeding to which a harsh name
      might be given. To use a cloud negative properly, the reader should
      consult the chapter on "<a href="#xiv">Combination Printing</a>."
    </p>

    <p>
      There is another artifice, however, that does away with the blank sky.
      It is practised by some of the leading photographers in England, and may
      be put in requisition instead of the more elaborate double printing. In
      order to do this, a not quite opaque sky&mdash;that is, one which "prints
      in" a little&mdash;is necessary. Very effective clouds may be produced by a
      paint-brush and lamp-black, Indian ink, or gamboge, by painting them
      artistically <em>at the back of the negative</em>. It matters not if the clouds
      so formed show sharp lines and dots, since, if the printing be done in
      diffused light, the thickness of the glass plate on which the negative
      is taken shades these off, and gives them the soft edges which are
      natural to clouds. The clouds may take any of the usual shapes as seen
      in nature, and the paint should not be applied too strongly, but should
      have a certain amount of transparency. In some negatives we have seen
      taken on dry plates, the sky was very transparent, and, when printed
      in the ordinary manner, showed a good deal more than perceptible tint.
      Yet, by a judicious masking, fleecy clouds floating in a light sky were
      produced, which deceived the greatest connoisseurs in such matters.
    </p>

    <p>
      We will now describe how such a negative should be prepared for printing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Black varnish should be carefully run round the sky-line on the face
      of the negative, for about a quarter of an inch. On the back of the
      negative the medium should cover the sky to within one-eighth of an inch
      of the sky-line, and by this means a sharp but <em>slightly softened edge</em>
      of the distant landscape was projected. The breadth of the black varnish
      border on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span> the back was slightly greater than that on the film side of
      the negative, being about an inch. A piece of cardboard was also roughly
      cut out to the sky-line, and left sufficiently broad so as to more than
      cover the sky when laid flat on it. The negative with the clouds painted
      on it was now placed in the pressure-frame, with the sensitive paper in
      contact with it. Outside the frame, and corresponding with the sky-line,
      the edge of the cardboard was placed, a small bar to act as a weight
      was placed across it as shown in the figure, and the top end supported
      by a couple of wooden pegs. The printing took place in diffused light.
      When the picture was withdrawn from the frame, the sky, being shaded
      gradually by the card, was printed in lightly, whilst the remaining
      portion of the negative received the full light; the sky, as is right it
      should be, was darker near the zenith than toward the horizon, where it
      was, in fact, white; but since the clouds were printed in at the top,
      the baldness of the white sky was avoided.
    </p>

    <div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
      <img src="images/fig20.jpg" width="300" height="215" alt="" />
        <div class="caption"><i>Fig.</i> 20.</div>
    </div>

    <p>
      Excellent clouds may also be produced by the stump and crayon on tissue
      paper, many of the effects of delicate clouds being capable of being
      produced in this manner. A certain amount of skill is required in
      producing them, but nothing beyond that which a little practice can give.
    </p>

    <p>
      We may add that, instead of using this cardboard shade, some printers
      prefer first to entirely mask the sky and print in the landscape, than
      to mask the landscape, and to use a movable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span> screen over the negative,
      drawing it backwards and forwards during exposure, taking the precaution
      that the top of the sky receives the most exposure. The method of
      using the cloud negative, we have already said, will be found in the
      chapter on "<a href="#xiv">Combination Printing</a>." Above all things, the printer must
      bear in mind that if there be any <em>distance</em> in the picture, the sky,
      when it meets the margin, must be only very delicately tinted. Let it
      be remembered that a picture is often spoilt by printing in clouds too
      heavily. The clouds for an effect should be most delicate, with no heavy
      massive shadows which overwhelm those of the landscape itself. We are
      only talking of the ordinary landscape when the effect of storms is not
      desired. It is not within the scope of this work to show how a landscape
      and a sky negative may be printed into one plate to form a transparency
      from which a new negative may be made; suffice it to say that, by using
      collodio-chloride, or by the use of a slow dry plate and exposing to
      candle light, the former may be produced in almost the same way that the
      print is produced, and a negative may then be produced in the camera or
      by a dry plate.

    <small>PREPARING THE PORTRAIT NEGATIVE.</small></h2>

    <p class="noi">
      <span class="smcap">So</span> much has been written on the subject of what is called "retouching"
      the negative, that it would be a waste of space to enter very fully
      into details here. It is now generally admitted that working on the
      negative is not only legitimate, but that it is absolutely necessary,
      if a presentable portrait is to be printed. The only question is, where
      to stop. Professional retouchers, in too many cases, do too much, and
      by doing so they "overstep the modesty of nature," and turn the lovely
      delicacy, softness, and texture of living nature into the appearance
      of hard and cold marble statuary. Everything that is necessary to do
      to a portrait negative is very simple; it should be corrected, not
      remodelled. Freckles and accidental spots should be stopped out, high
      lights may be strengthened, and shadows softened. We may here briefly
      indicate the technical methods of performing these operations.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some operators pour a solution of gum over the negative after fixing,
      and when it is dry work upon the surface of the gum; but it is better
      and safer to retouch the negative after it has been varnished. The
      varnish must be allowed to become thoroughly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span> hard before any working
      upon it is attempted. A negative varnished at night should be ready to
      be retouched the next morning. If very little has to be done to the
      negative, it may be done at once without preparation; but it is often
      advisable to prepare the surface of the varnish to take the lead pencil,
      with which the greater part of the work is done. This is done with
      "retouching medium."
    </p>

    <p>
      Several preparations under this or similar names are sold by stock
      dealers, all of them giving, as far as we have tried them, equally good
      results. If the photographer prefers to make his own medium, he may
      do so by diluting mastic, or any similar varnish, such as copal, with
      turpentine. Apply the medium to the parts that it is intended to work on
      with the finger, and allow to dry, which it does in a few minutes. Place
      the negative on a retouching desk, and commence to fill up with the
      point of the pencil all spots that are not required, such as freckles or
      uneven marks. Some operators begin at the top of a face and work evenly
      downwards. This is a bad plan, and usually results in a mechanical
      flattening of the face; it is better to fill in here and there as
      necessity appears to arise. The high lights may now be strengthened,
      taking care not to make them violent or spotty. The shadows of the face
      will be found to require softening, but the general shape of the shadows
      must not be altered, and in modifying lines&mdash;such as the lines in the
      forehead and under the eye&mdash;take care not to remove them altogether. An
      old man without wrinkles is an unnatural and ghastly object&mdash;the "marble
      brow" of the poet should be left to literature. The best pencils to
      use are Faber's Siberian lead, the hard ones in preference. HH and HHH
      are the sorts usually employed. The pencils must be kept very finely
      pointed. To ensure this, a piece of wood covered with glass cloth should
      be kept always at hand on which to grind the leads to a point.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sometimes there are portions of a negative that require more filling
      up than can be done with a pencil; in this case water-colour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span> must be
      employed. Indigo or Prussian blue is, perhaps, best for the purpose,
      because these pigments allow a more appreciable or visible quantity
      to be laid on without becoming opaque than any of the warm colours.
      Sometimes parts&mdash;such as the arm of a child&mdash;will print too dark when in
      contrast with a white dress; in this case it will be necessary to paint
      over the part on the back of the negative, or to cut out a piece of
      <em>papier minerale</em> to the shape, and paste it over the dark part, also on
      the glass side of the negative.

    <small>VIGNETTING</small></h2>

    <p class="noi">
      <span class="smcap">Of</span> the many varieties of small portraiture, the vignette is, perhaps,
      the most popular, and, when well done, is certainly the most refined
      and delicate. Two things are to be especially avoided in vignetting.
      The form of the vignette should not follow the form of the figure
      closely, as it is too often made to do, and dark backgrounds should
      not be employed. The qualities to endeavour to attain are softness of
      gradation, and an arrangement of the forms of the vignette that shall
      throw out the head and figure, and the resulting print should somewhat
      resemble a sketch, finished if you like, but sketchy in effect. Although
      the background should be light, it ought not to be white, but of a
      tint that would just throw up the white of a lady's head-dress. If the
      background screen could be painted so that a little shade should appear
      over the shoulders of a sitter for a head, or rather darker behind the
      lower part of a three-quarter figure, so much the better would be the
      effect. It would be difficult to find a case where gradation could not
      be of advantage in a background; however slight, it conduces especially
      to relief.
    </p>

    <p>
      Having stated what should be aimed at in vignettes, we now come to the
      technical methods of producing them.
    </p>

    <p>
      In many cases vignetting is considered to be a merely mechanical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
      operation, and very often looks like it. Perhaps the trade have more to
      answer for than the printer, since the qualities of the wares advertised
      for the use of the vignetter are often exaggerated to such a degree that
      they are supposed to be suitable to any pictures. Vignette glasses are
      not so common as they used to be, but they certainly are useful in some
      instances; we almost think that the methods of producing vignetting
      apparatus which will be described shortly, superior to them. In case the
      printer should wish, however, to use these glasses, here is a method by
      which he may produce them. Have a piece of orange glass, flashed on one
      side only, rather larger than the size of the picture to be vignetted.
      Take a rough print, and trace round, in the proper position on the
      glass with an ink line, the point to which the picture should extend.
      This should be marked on the unflashed surface of the glass&mdash;that is,
      the surface on which the glass is uncoloured. Place the plate so marked
      on a white surface, flashed side uppermost, and make a solution of
      hydrofluoric acid and water, 1 part of the former to 3 of the latter,
      in a gutta-percha dish or bottle.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote-22" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 22">[22]</a> Make a pad of flannel and cotton
      wool at the end of a stick, about the size of a large nut, and drop
      this into the solution. Dab this on the coloured surface of the glass
      in the central portions where the print is to be completely printed in,
      gradually working out to the inked line. Always work from the centre to
      the edges, and dilute the acid with a little water as it approaches the
      margins. By degrees the flashing will be dissolved away in the centre,
      and, if properly performed, the colour will gradually be eaten away,
      till the glass is colourless in the centre, and keeping its full shade
      of orange at the ink lines. The glass is then washed, and is ready for
      use.
    </p>

    <p>
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
      The most popular plan of vignetting is with cotton-wool. We believe that
      the greater part of the vignetting done in England is by this clumsy,
      costly, and difficult method. It requires more time and attention than
      any other way of producing the same results. Its advantages are, that it
      is more "elastic," and allows the operator more scope for attention than
      other methods. In the hands of a person who has very great skill, taste,
      and patience, it is undoubtedly most useful; but when used by anything
      lower than the highest skill, the results are almost always hard and
      inartistic. The operation is thus performed. A hole is cut in a piece
      of cardboard, which is placed over the negative. Under the edges of the
      cardboard is placed cotton-wool, which is lightly pulled out, so as to
      slightly shade the vignette, and produce the vignetting gradation.
    </p>

    <p>
      The next methods of vignetting are dependent on simple laws of optics.
      Suppose you cut a round hole in a card, say, half-inch in diameter, and
      so arrange it that all the light getting to a sensitive paper comes
      through this hole, and that the card is for our experiment placed
      half-an-inch from the paper. Now place the hole so as to face the sky,
      but so as the sun has no direct rays falling through the hole. It will
      be found that the greatest darkening will not occupy a space exactly
      opposite the hole, but be <i>away from the side on which the light is
      brightest</i>. The dark round patch will be shaded gradually off till
      a line is reached where, practically, the light has no effect&mdash;that
      is, if the surface of the card next the paper be blackened. It will
      be noted, however, that the shading is not equal on both sides, but
      that the gradation is most extended away from the side on which the
      light is brightest. A good example of what is meant will be to try the
      experiment of placing the paper and card flat on the ground in the
      angle between two walls, both of which are in shadow. It will be seen
      that the brightest gradation takes place in the direction exactly away
      from the angle of the walls. Next repeat the experiment, making the
      hole point to the sky, which is equally illuminated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span> and pointing well
      away from the sun. It will be found that the gradations are equal, and
      the greatest darkening exactly opposite the hole. Raise the card next
      to the height of one inch, and the gradations will be found to be more
      extended and softer. The reason of this can be well understood by a
      glance at the figures. In both, suppose A B to represent the section of
      the card, and C D the hole in it, and the dotted circle the sky, and E
      F the paper. Take the points <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, and <i>c</i> on the paper, and let us
      in the three instances see what relative illumination they will receive.
      <i>a</i> is opposite the hole, and receives the light from a circle of sky of
      which <i>d e</i> is diameter, and <i>b</i> from an ellipse of which <i>h k</i> is one
      diameter, and <i>e</i> from an ellipse of which <i>f g</i> is one diameter. In the
      first case, where the card is <span class="frac"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> inch from the paper, <i>h k</i> is about
      one-fifth of <i>d e</i>, and <i>g f</i> about one-third of <i>d f</i>, and since the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
      ellipses vary as their two diameters multiplied together, the point <i>b</i>
      would receive only one-twenty-fifth the light that <i>a</i> received, and <i>c</i>
      about one-ninth.

    </div>

    <p>
      In <a href="#fig21">fig. 21</a> the card is raised one inch from the paper, and here <i>f g</i> is
      about three-quarters of <i>d e</i>, and <i>h k</i> about two-fifths; therefore,
      in this case, the light on B would be only <a name="four" id="four"></a><ins title="Original omitted hyphen after four">four-twenty-fifths</ins>,
      or about one-sixth of that acting on <i>a</i>, and about nine-sixteenths or
      one-half nearly on <i>c</i>. It is thus evident that the further away the
      card is, the more extended will be the gradations. Again, suppose, in
      the last figure, the bit of sky at <i>g f</i> was twice as bright as at <i>d
      e</i>, then the amount of light acting on <i>c</i> would be the same as that
      acting on <i>a</i>. It will thus be seen how important it is for proper
      gradation that the hole in the card should be exposed to an equally
      illuminated sky, or that some artifice should be employed to render the
      illumination equal. If we paste a bit of tissue paper over C D, this is
      accomplished, for then it becomes the source of illumination, and it
      is illuminated equally all over, since on every part it receives the
      light of the whole sky; but this is not the case if it is transparent
      to diffused light, and is never the case if it is exposed to direct
      sunlight, since a shadow of the hole is always cast on the paper
      beneath. If you choose to put another piece of tissue paper, (say) one
      inch above the hole, and extending over the whole length of the card,
      this difficulty is got rid of, and this last piece of tissue paper
      illuminates that pasted over the hole C D, and the gradations will then
      be nearly perfect.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now to apply the above to forming a vignetting block.
    </p>

    <p>
      Suppose we have a one-inch head to vignette and to show the shoulders
      and chest, to be of the size of a carte-de-visite, that the background
      is about a half-tone between black and white, and that but a trace of
      it shall appear above the head. To make a good vignette, the graduation
      from black to perfect white should lie within a limit of half an inch
      for a carte size portrait. The question then arises at what distance
      from the plate should a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span> vignetting card be cut to help this object,
      and what shape should be made the hole in the card. We take it that
      one-fifth of the light necessary to produce a full black tone would
      hardly produce any effect on the sensitised paper; knowing this and the
      size of the aperture, we can calculate exactly what height the card
      could be raised. Take the breadth between the shoulders that is to be
      fully printed as 1<span class="frac"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> inches, then by constructing a figure similar to
      figures 18 or 19 we shall find that the necessary
      height is about one-third of an inch.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote-23" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 23">[23]</a>

    <p>
      By judiciously cutting out an aperture in the card and vignetting,
      defects in a background may often be entirely eliminated from the
      print. Proceed in this way: Take a print of the portrait, and cut out
      the figure in such a way as to get rid of the defective background,
      and then place this on a piece of thick card (we prefer a thick card,
      since it will not sag easily, and thus alter the gradation), and cut
      out an <a name="aperture" id="aperture"></a><ins title="Original has aperature">aperture</ins> corresponding to it. The outsides of most
      carte-de-visite frames are raised from the glass about one-third of an
      inch; place the card on the front so that the aperture corresponds to
      the figure on the negative, and tack it on to the frame. The dotted
      lines (<a href="#fig23">fig. 23</a>) show the card fastened <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>on
      to the frame, and the opening
      left. This latter may be covered with tissue paper, and the frame placed
      in diffused light from the sky. In some cases it may be necessary to use
      a larger printing frame than the ordinary carte frame, in which case
      the operator should be able to make a vignetting apparatus raised at a
      proper <a name="height" id="height"></a><ins title="Original has heigth">height</ins> from the glass. Suppose it is required to raise
      the opening half an inch above the glass, and that the card is 4<span class="frac"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub></span> by
      3<span class="frac"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span>.

    <div class="caption"><i>Fig.</i> 24.</div>
    </div>

    <p>
      Take the card and rule rectangles as shown (<a href="#fig24">fig. 24</a>), the inner one
      being 4<span class="frac"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub></span> by 3<span class="frac"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> inches, the next one <span class="frac"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> an inch outside that,
      and the third <span class="frac"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> an inch outside that again. Cut out the outer
      rectangle entirely, so that we have a piece of card of the size ABCD.
      Take a needle point, and prick through the card at the points EFGH and
      join these points at the back of the card by lines. Now take a sharp
      penknife, and, having laid a flat edge along, cut the card half through
      its thickness along KL, LM, MN, and NK. Turn the card over, and cut
      along the lines corresponding to EH, HG, GE, and FE, also half way
      through the thickness of the card. Turn the card over once more, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
      cut out the shaded pieces at the corners. Now bend the card along the
      cuts, and a raised block will result of this shape. The corners are
      held together by pieces of gummed or albumenized paper, and the block
      is ready for an aperture to be cut in it according to the portrait to
      be printed. Wooden grooves may be glued along the top of the vignetting
      frame, into which cards containing other apertures can be slipped.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote-24" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 24">[24]</a>

    <p>
      Take a piece of soft wood, half an inch thick for a cabinet size&mdash;a
      thinner piece should be selected for a smaller picture&mdash;of a larger
      dimension than the negative; in the centre of this cut a hole of the
      shape of, but much smaller than, the desired vignette. One side of the
      hole should be very much bevelled away, as represented in this section
      (<a href="#fig26">fig. 26</a>). Place this block on the glass of the printing-frame, bevelled
      side under, the hole being exactly over the part of the negative from
      which the vignette is to be printed. The hole must now be covered with
      tissue paper or ground glass, and the frame placed flat on a table to
      print. The size of the hole in relation to the size of the vignette
      will be easily ascertained by a little experience without the labour of
      elaborate calculations. On dull days the tissue paper or ground glass
      may be omitted.
    </p>

    <p>
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
      This method is very simple and effective. A quantity of vignetting
      blocks of various sizes and shapes could be made by a carpenter, or by
      the printer, and should be always at hand.
    </p>

    <p>
      A vignetting block should never be less than a quarter of an inch away
      from the glass, otherwise the gradations will be too abrupt.

    <small>ARTISTIC METHODS OF PRINTING THE PORTRAIT.</small></h2>

    <p class="noi">
      <span class="smcap">Having</span> <a name="described" id="described"></a><ins title="Original has discribed">described</ins> in the last chapter the various
      mechanical arrangements by which a simple vignette is produced, we will
      now proceed to give some account of how that and other forms of printing
      can be turned to the most artistic account in portraiture.
    </p>

    <p>
      The idea that printing is a mere mechanical operation was exploded long
      ago. It is now recognized that the final result owes a good deal of its
      artistic effect to the way in which the negative is dealt with after it
      is varnished, and especially to its treatment by the printer. There are
      many varieties of vignettes, and the method is useful in various ways.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Plain Vignettes</em>.&mdash;The usual vignetted portrait is that which
      represents a good-sized head and shoulders in the space allotted to the
      picture. For a carte-de-visite, a head measuring about 1<span class="frac"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub></span> inches
      from the top of the head to the chin is a good proportion. Larger sizes
      are often made, but they look coarse and vulgar, as if the photographer
      had tried how much quantity he could give for the money, regardless of
      quality; and even if the quality is good, the vulgar effect is still
      there. For a cabinet size a head of 1<span class="frac"><sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub></span> or 1<span class="frac"><sup>7</sup>/<sub>8</sub></span> inches is quite large
      enough. A very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span> pretty style is that in which the gradation is carried
      out so gradually as only to end with the edge of the paper.
    </p>

      <p>
      <em>Three-quarter Length Vignettes</em>.&mdash;A three-quarter length figure of a
      lady, either standing or sitting, makes a pretty picture; for gentlemen,
      a three-quarter vignette is not so good, although it is admissible. It
      is difficult to make the legs look anything but awkward when they are
      vignetted into empty space at the knee. For three-quarter vignettes a
      light, sketchy landscape background may be used with effect.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are many varieties of what may be called "fancy printing," in
      which the vignette takes a conspicuous part. The first style that we
      will consider is that of
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Vignettes on a Tinted Ground</em>.&mdash;Print a vignette in the usual way.
      Take it out of the frame, and place it on a board covered with velvet
      or flannel, to prevent the paper shifting. Cover the print with glass,
      and place over the printed part a piece of black paper roughly torn to
      the shape, and rather smaller than the vignette. Place the whole in
      the light until the white margin is slightly tinted, or "blushed," as
      <a name="it" id="it"></a><ins title="Original omits is">it is</ins> sometimes called. The edges of the black mask should be
      slightly turned up or kept moving to prevent the junction of the tinting
      and the vignette being visible.
    </p>

    <p>
      The above method represents a vignetted head on smooth grey paper,
      and is useful to show up the high lights on the face; but there is a
      modification of this effect, in which the appearance of a sketch on
      rough drawing-paper is produced.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Vignettes on Rough Drawing-paper</em>.&mdash;If, instead of placing a piece of
      plain glass over the masked print, a thin negative of some diaper or
      pattern had been used, the design could have been printed on the paper
      instead of the even tint. A very good negative for this purpose is
      made as follows:&mdash;Obtain a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span> sheet of the roughest drawing-paper, take
      a camel-hair brush dipped in thin sepia, and brush it evenly over the
      paper; the colour will fall into the depressions of the paper, and make
      the roughness still more visible. This should now be placed where a side
      light falls upon it, and photographed. A very thin negative is all that
      is required. This negative should be used in place of the plain glass,
      and, if not printed too dark, the effect of the delicate vignette inside
      the rough tint is very pleasing. It is better when using negatives for
      this purpose to place them in pressure-frames, instead of merely placing
      them or the print on the velvet board, to print, or perfect contact may
      not be obtained.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Medallions</em>.&mdash;Medallions of oval and other forms are now a good deal
      used for small portraits. These are simply produced by gumming a mask,
      made of black or yellow paper, with an oval or other-shaped aperture,
      on to the negative, the mask preserving the part it covers white. These
      masks can be bought from the dealers cheaper and better than they can be
      made. Eccentric shapes are, usually, in bad taste; the oval and dome are
      quite sufficient for all purposes. If, instead of leaving the outside
      of the print&mdash;that protected by the mask&mdash;white, it could be tinted,
      the lights in the picture would have greater value, and the effect be
      <a name="improved" id="improved"></a><ins title="Original has two fullstops">improved.</ins> To do this, the printed part should be covered
      with a black-paper disc corresponding with the mask used in printing,
      the print covered with glass, and exposed to the light until printed the
      required depth. In performing this operation it will be found convenient
      to gum the disc to the covering-glass. If texture could be added to
      this tinted margin, then another element of beauty would be added.
      This may be done in a similar manner to that described for vignettes,
      by using a negative made from rough drawing-paper; but, in this case,
      there is opportunity for a greater choice of objects from which to
      make the tinting negative, such as grained leather, marble of various
      kinds, paper-hangings&mdash;when suitable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span> patterns can be obtained&mdash;and from
      the borders of old prints. In this, as in many other things connected
      with photography, there is a good deal of room for bad taste, which
      the photographer must try to avoid. He must remember that all these
      surrounding designs should assist the portrait, and not distract the
      attention from it.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Vignettes in Ornamental Borders.</em>&mdash;The writer has lately produced some
      effects that have given much pleasure by using designs specially drawn
      for the purpose. The designs principally consist of an oval in the
      centre for the portrait, and a tablet underneath, on which the original
      of the portrait may sign his name. These forms are surrounded by flowers
      and other objects conventionally treated. The spaces for the portrait
      and name should be stopped out with black varnish, so as to print
      white. The easiest way to use these ornamental border negatives is as
      follows:&mdash;First print the border negative; you will then have a print
      with a white oval space in the centre. Place this print on the portrait
      negative, taking care that it occupies the proper position in the oval.
      This is easily ascertained by holding the print and negative up to the
      light. It should then be placed in the frame and printed, care being
      taken that the vignetted gradation does not spread beyond its limits
      over the border.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a good deal of variety to be got out of the combination of the
      mask and vignette. Here is one of them.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Combination of Medallion and Vignette.</em>&mdash;Vignette a head into the
      centre of the paper; when this is done, place over it a black paper oval
      disc, taking care that the head comes in the centre under the mask.
      Place a piece of glass over the whole, and print. When the disc is
      removed, the print will represent a vignette surrounded by a dark oval.
      Many variations may be made of this form of picture, and there is much
      scope for skill and taste.
    </p>

    <p>
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
      Any of the tinting negatives above described may be used, or they can
      be made from designs drawn on paper as we have already stated, or from
      natural objects. But if our reader has followed us clearly thus far, he
      is now in a position to form combinations for himself. This we recommend
      him to do, for there is an additional beauty in anything in art that
      indicates a distinctive style or shows thought and originality. There is
      too much tendency in portraitists to run in grooves, which the universal
      prevalence of the two styles, card and cabinet, help to promote. But
      we must caution the young photographer against the mistake of making
      changes for the sake of change. The "loud," and the bizarre, may attract
      foolish people, but it is only the beautiful that will secure the
      attention of the cultivated and refined.

    <small>COMBINATION PRINTING.</small></h2>

    <p class="noi">
      <span class="smcap">The</span> scope of photography is wider than those who have only taken a
      simple portrait or landscape suppose. It is almost impossible to design
      a group that could not have been reproduced from life by the means our
      art places at our disposal. We do not mean to assert that such subjects
      as Michael Angelo's Last Judgment, or Raphael's Transfiguration, for
      instance, have ever been done in photography; but it is not so much
      the fault of the art, as of the artists, that very elaborate pictures
      have not been successfully attempted. It has not been the failing of
      the materials, unplastic as they are when compared with paint and
      pencils; it has been the absence of the requisite amount of skill in
      the photographer in the use of them, that will account for the dearth
      of great works in photography. The means by which these pictures could
      have been accomplished is Combination Printing, a method which enables
      the photographer to represent objects in different planes in proper
      focus, to keep the true atmospheric and linear relation of varying
      distances, and by which a picture can be divided into separate portions
      for execution, the parts to be afterwards printed together on one paper,
      thus enabling the operator to devote all his attention to a single
      figure or sub-group at a time, so that if any part be imperfect, from
      any cause, it can be substituted by another without the loss of the
      whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span> picture, as would be the case if taken at one operation. By
      thus devoting the attention to individual parts, independently of the
      others, much greater perfection can be obtained in details, such as the
      arrangement of draperies, the refinement of pose, and expression.
    </p>

    <p>
      The most simple form of combination printing, and the one most easy
      of accomplishment and most in use by photographers, is that by which
      a natural sky is added to a landscape. It is well-known to all
      photographers that it is almost impossible to obtain a good and suitable
      sky to a landscape under ordinary circumstances. Natural skies are
      occasionally seen in stereoscopic slides and very small views; but I am
      now writing of pictures, and not of toys. It rarely happens that a sky
      quite suitable to the landscape occurs in the right place at the time
      it is taken, and, if it did, the exposure necessary for the view would
      be sufficient to quite obliterate the sky; and if this difficulty were
      obviated by any of the sun-shades, cloud-stops, or other inefficient
      dodges occasionally proposed, the movement of the clouds during the
      few seconds necessary for the landscape would quite alter the forms
      and light and shade, making what should be the sky&mdash;often sharp and
      crisp in effect&mdash;a mere smudge, without character or form. All these
      difficulties are got over by combination printing, the only objections
      being that a little more care and trouble are required, and some thought
      and knowledge demanded. The latter should be considered an advantage,
      for photographs, of a kind, are already too easy to produce. Of course,
      when a landscape is taken with a blank sky, and that blank is filled up
      with clouds from another negative, the result will depend, to a very
      great degree, upon the art knowledge of the photographer in selecting
      a suitable sky, as well as upon his skill in overcoming the mechanical
      difficulties of the printing. It is not necessary here to enter into
      a description of the art aspect of the matter, as that has often been
      discussed; so we will confine ourselves to the mechanical details.
    </p>

    <p>
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
      The landscape negative must have a dense sky, or, if it be weak, or have
      any defects, it must be stopped out with black varnish. In this case, it
      is better to apply the varnish to the back of the glass; by this means
      a softer edge is produced in printing than if painted on the varnished
      surface. With some subjects, such as those that have a tolerably level
      horizon, it is sufficient to cover over part of the sky while printing,
      leaving that part near the horizon gradated from the horizon into white.
    </p>

    <p>
      It may here be remarked that in applying black varnish to the back of a
      negative, occasions will often be found where a softened or vignetted
      edge is required for joining, where a vignette glass or cotton wool
      cannot be applied; in such cases the edge of the varnish may be softened
      off by dabbing slightly, before it is set, with the finger, or, if a
      broader and more delicately gradated edge be required, a dabber made
      with wash-leather may be employed with great effect.
    </p>

    <p>
      When an impression is taken, the place where the sky ought to be will,
      of course, be plain white paper; a negative of clouds is then placed in
      the printing-frame, and the landscape is laid down on it, so arranged
      that the sky will print on to the white paper in its proper place;
      the frame is then exposed to the light, and the landscape part of the
      picture is covered up with a mask edged with cotton wool. The sky is
      vignetted into the landscape, and it will be found that the slight
      lapping over of the vignetted edge of the sky negative will not be
      noticed in the finished print. There is another way of vignetting the
      sky into the landscape, which is, perhaps, better and more convenient.
      Instead of the mask edged with cotton wool, which requires moving
      occasionally, a curved piece of zinc or cardboard is used. Here is
      a section of the arrangement. The straight line represents the sky
      negative, and the part where it joins the landscape is partly covered
      with the curved shade. Skies so treated must not, of course, be printed
      in sunlight.

    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
      It is sometimes necessary to take a panoramic view. This is usually
      done, when the pantascopic camera is not employed, by mounting two
      prints together, so that the objects in the landscape shall coincide;
      but this is an awkward method of doing what could be much better
      accomplished by combination printing. The joining of the two prints is
      always disagreeably visible, and quite spoils the effect. To print the
      two halves of a landscape, taken on two plates, together, the following
      precautions must be observed: both negatives must be taken before the
      camera-stand is moved, the camera, which must be quite horizontal,
      pointing to one half of the scene for the first negative, and then
      turned to the remaining half of the view for the second negative. The
      two negatives should be obtained under exactly the same conditions of
      light, or they will not match; they should also be so taken that a
      margin of an inch and a-half or two inches is allowed to overlap each
      other; that is to say, about two inches of each negative must contain
      the same or centre portion of the scene. It is advisable, also, that
      they should be of the same density; but this is not of very great
      consequence, because any slight discrepancy in this respect can be
      allowed for in printing. In printing vignettes with cotton wool, or a
      straight-edged vignette glass, the edge of the left-hand negative on
      the side that is to join the other, taking care to cover up the part
      of the paper that will be required for the companion negative; when
      sufficiently printed, take the print out of the frame, and substitute
      the right-hand negative; lay down the print so that it exactly falls on
      the corresponding parts of the first part printed (this will be found
      less difficult, after a little practice, than it appears), and expose
      to the light, vignetting the edge of this negative, also, so that the
      vignetted part exactly falls on the softened edge of the impression
      already done. If great care be taken to print both plates exactly alike
      in depth, it will be impossible to discover the join in the finished
      print. If thought necessary, a sky may be added, as before described,
      or it may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span> gradated in the light, allowing the horizon to be lighter
      than the upper part of the sky.

      Perhaps the greatest use to which combination printing is now put is
      in the production of portraits with natural landscape backgrounds.
      Many beautiful pictures, chiefly cabinets and card, have been done
      in this way by several photographers. The easiest kind of figure for
      a first attempt would be a three-quarter length of a lady, because
      you would then get rid of the foreground, and have to confine your
      attention to the upper part of the figure and the distance. Pictures
      of this kind have a very pleasing effect. In the figure negative,
      everything should be stopped out, with the exception of the figure,
      with black varnish; this should be done on the back of the glass when
      practicable, which produces a softer join; but for delicate parts&mdash;such
      as down the face&mdash;where the joins must be very close, and do not admit
      of anything approaching to vignetting, the varnish must be applied on
      the front. A much better effect than painting out the background of
      the figure negative is obtained by taking the figure with a white or
      very light screen behind it; this plan allows sufficient light to pass
      through the background to give an agreeable atmospheric tint to the
      distant landscape; and stopping out should only be resorted to when the
      background is too dark, or when stains or blemishes occur, that would
      injure the effect. An impression must now be taken which is not to be
      toned or fixed. Cut out the figure, and lay it, face downwards, on the
      landscape negative in the position you wish it to occupy in the finished
      print. It may be fixed in its position by gumming the corners near the
      lower edge of the plate. It is now ready for printing. It is usually
      found most convenient to print the figure negative first. When this has
      been done, the print must be laid down on the landscape negative so
      that the figure exactly covers the place prepared for it by the cut-out
      mask. When printed, the picture should be carefully examined, to see if
      the joins may be improved or made less visible. It will be found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span> that,
      in many places, the effect can be improved and the junctions made more
      perfect, especially when a light comes against a dark&mdash;such as a distant
      landscape against the dark part of a dress&mdash;by tearing away the edge of
      the mask covering the dark, and supplying its place by touches of black
      varnish at the back of the negative; this, in printing, will cause the
      line to be less defined, and the edges to soften into each other. If the
      background of the figure negative has been painted out, the sky will be
      represented by white paper; and as white paper skies are neither natural
      nor pleasing, it will be advisable to sun it down.

      If a full-length figure be desired, it will be necessary to photograph
      the ground with the figure, as it is almost impossible to make the
      shadow of a figure match the ground on which it stands in any other way.
      This may be done either out of doors or in the studio. The figure taken
      out of doors would, perhaps, to the critical eye, have the most natural
      effect, but this cannot always be done, neither can it be, in many
      respects, done so well. The light is more unmanageable out of doors,
      and the difficulty arising from the effect of wind on the dress is very
      serious. A slip of natural foreground is easily made up in the studio;
      the error to be avoided is the making too much of it. The simpler a
      foreground is in this case, the better will be the effect.

      The composition of a group should next engage the student's attention.
      In making a photograph of a large group, as many figures as possible
      should be obtained in each negative, and the position of the joins so
      contrived that they shall come in places where they shall be least
      noticed, if seen at all. It will be found convenient to make a sketch
      in pencil or charcoal of the composition before the photograph is
      commenced. The technical working out of a large group is the same as for
      a single figure; it is, therefore, not necessary to repeat the details;
      but we give a reduced copy, as a <a href="#frontispiece">frontispiece</a> to this volume, of a large
      combination picture, entitled "When the Day's Work is Done,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span> by Mr. H.
      P. Robinson, a description of the progress and planning of which may be
      of use to the student.
    </p>

    <p>
      A small rough sketch was first made of the idea, irrespective of any
      considerations of the possibility of its being carried out. Other small
      sketches were then made, modifying the subject to suit the figures
      available as models, and the accessories accessible without very much
      going out of the way to find them. From these rough sketches a more
      elaborate sketch of the composition, pretty much as it stands, and of
      the same size, 32 by 22 inches, was made, the arrangement being divided
      so that the different portions may come on 23 by 18 plates, and that the
      junctions may come in unimportant plates, easy to join, but not easy
      to be detected afterwards. The separate negatives were then taken. The
      picture is divided as follows:&mdash;
    </p>

    <p>
      The first negatives taken were the two of which the background is
      composed. The division runs down the centre, where the light wall is
      relieved by the dark beyond it. These two negatives were not printed
      separately&mdash;it is advisable to have as few printings as possible&mdash;but
      were carefully cut down with a diamond, and mounted on a piece of glass
      rather larger than the whole picture, the edges being placed in contact,
      making, in fact, <em>one</em> large negative of the interior of the cottage,
      into which it would be comparatively easy to put almost anything. The
      next negative was the old man. This included the table, chair, and
      matting on which his feet rest. This matting is roughly vignetted into
      the adjoining ground of the cottage negative. The great difficulty at
      first with this figure was the impossibility of joining the light head
      to the dark background; no amount of careful registration seemed equal
      to effect this difficult operation; but if it could not be done, it
      could be evaded. Several clever people have been able to point out the
      join round the head, down the forehead, and along the nose, but we have
      never been able to see it ourselves, because we know it is not there.
      This is how the difficulty was got over. The figure was taken with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span> a
      background that would print as nearly as possible as dark as the dark of
      the cottage. The join is nowhere near the head, but runs up the square
      back of the old woman's chair, then up the wall, and across the picture,
      over the head in an irregular line, and descends on the old man's back,
      whence it was easy to carry it down the dark edge of his dress and the
      chairs till it comes to the group of baskets, pails, &amp;c., that fill
      up the corner. On the other side, the join runs along the edge of the
      table, and finds its way out where the floor coverings come together.
      The old lady was then photographed, and is simply joined round the edge;
      so also was the group in the corner, and the glimpse of the village seen
      through the window.
    </p>

    <p>
      At first sight, it will appear difficult to place the partly-printed
      pictures in the proper place on the corresponding negative. There are
      many ways of doing this, either of which may be chosen to suit the
      subject. Sometimes a needle may be run through some part of the print,
      the point being allowed to rest on the corresponding part of the second
      negative. The print will then fall in its place at that point. Some
      other point has then to be found at a distance from the first; this may
      be done by turning up the paper to any known mark on the negative, and
      allowing the print to fall upon it; if the two separate points fall
      on the right places, all the others must be correct. Another way of
      joining the prints from the separate negatives is by placing a candle
      or lamp under the glass of the printing-frame&mdash;practically, to use a
      glass table&mdash;and throwing a light through the negative and paper; the
      join can then be seen through. But the best method is to make register
      marks on the negatives. This is done in the following manner. We will
      suppose that we wish to print a figure with a landscape background
      from two negatives, the foreground having been taken with the figure.
      At the two bottom corners of the figure negative make two marks with
      black varnish, thus <img src="images/symbols.jpg" width="25" height="16" alt="Symbols
      resembling the bottom left and right of a frame" />
      will print white in the picture. A proof is now taken, and the outline
      of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span> figure cut out accurately. Where the foreground and background
      join, the paper may be torn across, and the edges afterwards vignetted
      with black varnish on the back of the negatives. This mark is now
      fitted in its place on the landscape negative. Another print is now
      taken of the figure negative, and the white corner marks cut away very
      accurately with a pair of scissors. The print is now carefully applied
      to the landscape negative, so that the mark entirely covers those
      parts of the print already finished. The landscape is then printed in.
      Before, however, it is removed from the printing-frame, if, on partial
      examination, the joins appear to be perfect, two lead pencil or black
      varnish marks are made on the mark round the cut-out corners at the
      bottom of the print. After the first successful proof there is no need
      for any measurement or fitting to get the two parts of the picture to
      join perfectly; all that is necessary is merely to cut out the little
      white marks, and fit the corners to the corresponding marks on the
      mask; and there is no need to look if the joins coincide at other
      places, because, if two points are right, it follows that all must be
      so. This method can be applied in a variety of ways to suit different
      circumstances.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is always well to have as few paintings as possible, and it
      frequently happens that two or more negatives can be printed together.
      For instance, the picture we have been discussing&mdash;"When the Day's
      Work is Done"&mdash;is produced from six negatives, but it only took three
      printings. The two negatives of which the cottage is composed was, as
      already explained, set up on a large sheet of glass, and printed at
      once; the old man was also set upon another glass of the same size, with
      the negative of the glimpse through the window; and the old woman was
      printed in like manner, with the corner group of baskets, &amp;c. So that
      here were practically three negatives only. These were registered with
      corner marks so accurately that not a single copy has been lost through
      bad joins.

    <p>
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
      There are one or two things to consider briefly before concluding this
      subject.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is true that combination printing&mdash;allowing, as it does, much
      greater liberty to the photographer, and much greater facilities for
      representing the truth of nature&mdash;also admits, from these very facts,
      of a wide latitude for abuse; but the photographer must accept the
      conditions at his own peril. If he <a name="finds" id="finds"></a><ins title="Orignal had find">finds</ins> that he is not sufficiently
      advanced in knowledge of art, and has not sufficient reverence for
      nature, to allow him to make use of these liberties, let him put on his
      fetters again, and confine himself to one plate. It is certain (and this
      we put in italics, to impress it more strongly on the memory) that <i>a
      photograph produced by combination printing must be deeply studied in
      every particular, so that no departure from the truth of nature shall
      be discovered by the closest scrutiny</i>. No two things must occur in
      one picture that cannot happen in nature at the same time. If a sky
      is added to a landscape, the light must fall on the clouds and on the
      earth from the same source and in the same direction. This is a matter
      that should not be done by judgment alone, but by judgment guided by
      observation of nature. Effects are often seen, especially in cloud-land,
      very puzzling to the calm reasoner when he sees them in a picture;
      but these are the effects that are often best worth preserving, and
      which should never be neglected, because it may possibly happen that
      somebody will not understand it, and, therefore, say it is false, and,
      arguing still further on the wrong track, will say that combination
      printing always produces falsehoods, and must be condemned. A short
      anecdote may, perhaps, be allowed here. Some time ago a photograph of
      a landscape and sky was sent to a gentleman whose general judgment in
      art was admitted to be excellent; but he knew that combination printing
      was sometimes employed. In acknowledging the receipt he said, "Thank
      you for the photograph; it is a most extraordinary effect; sensational,
      certainly, but very beautiful; but it shows, by what it is, what
      photography<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span> cannot do; your sky does not match your landscape; it must
      have been taken at a different time of day, at another period of the
      year. A photograph is nothing if not true." Now it so happened that
      the landscape and sky were taken at the same time, the only difference
      being that the sky had a shorter exposure than the landscape, which was
      absolutely necessary to get the clouds at all, and does not affect the
      result. Another instance arose in connection with a picture representing
      a group of figures with a landscape background. Four of the figures
      were taken on one plate, at one operation; yet a would-be critic wrote
      at some length to prove that these figures did not agree one with
      another; that the light fell on them from different quarters; that the
      perspective of each had different points of sight; and that each figure
      was taken from a different point of view! These two cases are mentioned
      to show that it is sometimes a knowledge of the means employed, rather
      than a knowledge of nature&mdash;a foregone conclusion that the thing must
      be wrong, rather than a conviction, from observation, that it is not
      right&mdash;that influences the judgment of those who are not strong enough
      to say, "This thing is right," or "This thing is wrong, no matter by
      what means it may have been produced."

    <small>TONING THE PRINT.</small></h2>

    <p class="noi">
      <span class="smcap">If</span> a print on albumenized paper be fixed without any intermediate
      process, the result is that the image is of a red, disagreeable tone,
      and unsightly. Moreover, it will be found that, if such a print be
      exposed to the atmosphere, it rapidly loses its freshness, and fades. In
      order to avoid this unsightliness, resort is had to toning, the toning,
      in reality, being the substitution of some less attackable metal for
      the metallic silver which forms a portion of the print. The usual metal
      used for substitution is gold applied in the state of the ter-chloride.
      It is not very easy to tell precisely how the substitution is effected;
      the question is, at present, sub judice, and, therefore, we propose to
      omit any theory that may have been broached. It is sufficient to say
      that it is believed the first step towards the reduction of the gold is
      the production of a hydrated oxide, and never metallic gold. Be that as
      it may, if a finely-divided silver be placed in a solution of chloride
      of gold, the silver becomes converted into the chloride, and the gold is
      quickly reduced to the metallic state; and since gold combines with more
      chloride than does silver, it is manifest that when the substitution
      takes place,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote-25" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 25">[25]</a> the
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>metallic gold deposited must be very much less than the silver. The
      colouring power of gold is, however, very great, when in the fine state
      of division in which we have it, being an intense purple to blue colour,
      and a very little of this mixed visually with the ruddy or brown colour
      of the albuminate which has been discoloured by light gives, after
      fixing, a pleasing tone. A picture, when toned thus, is composed of
      silver subchloride, metallic gold, and an organic compound of silver.
      If a print be kept in the toning bath too long, we are all aware that
      the image becomes blue and feeble, and the same disaster happens when
      a toning bath is too strong, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</i>, is too rich in gold solution. The
      reason of this is, that too much gold is substituted for the silver in
      the sub-chloride, and there is in consequence too great a colour of the
      finely-precipitated gold seen. To make a toning bath, the first thing is
      to look after the gold. There is a good deal of chloride of gold sold,
      which is, in reality, not chloride of gold, but a double chloride of
      gold and of some such other base as potassium, and if it be paid for as
      pure chloride of gold, it is manifest that the price will be excessive.
      It is best to purchase pure chloride of gold, though it may be slightly
      acid, since subsequent operations correct the acidity. In our own
      practice we get fifteen-grain tubes, and break them open, and add to
      each grain one drachm of water, and in this state it is convenient
      to measure out. Thus, for every grain of gold to be used, it is only
      necessary to measure out one drachm into a measure. In delicate chemical
      operations, this would rightly be considered a rough method; but for a
      practical photographer it is sufficiently precise.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now if chloride of gold alone were used, it would be found that the
      prints, after immersion in a dilute solution, were poor and "measley,"
      and practice has told us that we must add something to the solution to
      enable it to act gradually and evenly. First of all, the gold solution
      must be perfectly neutral, and we know no better plan than adding to it
      a little powdered chalk, which at once neutralizes any free acid. It
      is not a matter of indifference<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span> what further retarder is added, for
      the reason that the more you retard the action, the more ruby-coloured
      becomes the gold, and less blue. A well-known experiment is to dissolve
      a little phosphorus in ether, and add it to a gallon of water, and then
      to drop in and stir about half a grain of chloride of gold. Phosphorus
      reduces the gold into the metallic state, but when so dilute the
      reduction takes <a name="place" id="place"></a><ins title="Original has places">place</ins> very slowly. The gold will, however,
      precipitate gradually, but it will be in such a fine state of division
      that it is a bright ruby colour. A very common addition to make to
      a toning bath is acetate of soda, and if the gold be in defect, the
      same appearance will take place in the solution. If chloride of lime,
      however, be added instead, and a commencement of precipitation of gold
      be brought about, the gold will be of a blue colour, having a slight
      tendency to purple. In this case, the grains of gold deposited are
      larger than when it is in the ruby state. The tone of the print then
      depends in a large measure on the degree of rapidity with which the gold
      is deposited. The quicker the deposit, the larger and bluer the gold,
      whilst an extremely slow deposition will give the red form. It often
      happens that no matter how long a print is immersed in a toning bath,
      it never takes a blue tone. The reason will be obvious from the above
      remarks.
    </p>

    <p>
      We now give some toning baths which are much used.
    </p>

    <p>
      This bath must be used immediately after mixing, since the gold is
      precipitated by the carbonate. The tones given by this bath are purple
      and black. The prints should be toned to dark brown for the purple tone,
      and a slightly blue tone for the black tone.

      The saturated solution of chloride of lime is made by taking the common
      <a name="disinfecting" id="disinfecting"></a><ins title="Original has desinfecting">disinfecting</ins> powder, and shaking a teaspoonful up in
      a pint bottle. When the solids have settled, the clear liquid can be
      decanted off, and corked up till required. This is the solution used
      above. It is as well to keep this solution in the dark room.
    </p>

    <p>
      The water with this bath should be hot (boiling better still), and the
      bath may be used when it is thoroughly cool. It is better, however, to
      keep it a day before using, since, when fresh, the action is apt to
      be too violent, and the prints are readily over-toned. The tone with
      this bath is a deep sepia to black. To get the first tone a very short
      immersion is necessary; the prints should be almost red. For a black
      tone the prints should be left in the solution till they are induced to
      be of a purple hue.

      This bath is a most excellent one in many respects, and should not be
      used under a week to get the best result. As this is a long time to
      keep a bath, it <a name="as" id="as"></a><ins title="Original has as as">is as</ins> well to have two always on stock. It keeps
      indefinitely if proper care be taken of it. This produces a purple or
      brown tone, according to the length of time the print is immersed in it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now, as to toning the print. After the day's printing is done, the
      prints should be placed in a pan of good fresh water, in order to
      dissolve out all or a certain amount of silver nitrate that is
      invariably left in them. A puncheon, such as is used in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span> dairies, is
      very convenient. It should be filled with water, and the prints placed
      in one by one, taking care that no one sticks to its neighbour, as this
      would be a fruitful source of unequal toning. Most water contains a
      little carbonate of lime and chloride of sodium, &amp;c.; the water will
      therefore become milky. When the prints have been in the first water
      for ten minutes, they should be removed to another vessel of water, one
      by one. The first wash water should be placed in a wooden tub, with
      a tap let into it about six inches above the base, together with a
      little common salt. The salt forms chloride of silver, which gradually
      precipitates, and the clear water is then drawn off on the next day, and
      the sediment is left undisturbed.
    </p>

    <div class="figcenter" style="width: 255px;">
    <img src="images/fig27.jpg" width="255" height="300" alt="" />
    <div class="caption"><i>Fig.</i> 27.</div>
    </div>

    <p>
      It now remains to see which toning bath is to be used. If No. 1 or 3,
      the whole of the free silver should as far as possible be washed away,
      which may entail three or four changes of water; the last two washings
      it will hardly repay to place in the tub; the second washing should
      certainly be added to it. If No. 2 toning bath be used, a little free
      silver should remain in the print; in fact, the washing should be
      confined to two changes of water.
    </p>

    <p>
      When toning operations are commenced, the toning solution is poured
      off from any sediment that may be in the bottle containing it into a
      dish a couple of inches wider each way than the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span> largest print which
      has to be toned. If big prints have to be toned, it is inadvisable to
      place more than a couple in the dish at the same time, since there is a
      certain awkwardness in judging of the amount of tone given to a print
      which is (say) between two or three. The prints should be placed face up
      in the solution, and great care should be taken that liquid separates
      each print from the next one to it, otherwise there will be patches of
      unequal toning. The dish containing the prints in the solution should be
      gently rocked to secure a proper mixture of the solution which may have
      been robbed of its gold in those strata next surface of the prints. The
      rocking is also advisable to cause any adhesion between two deep-toning
      prints impossible. If the prints be of small size, a dozen or more may
      be toned at one operation. Each print should be frequently brought to
      the surface of the liquid, and examined in order to see how the toning
      action is progressing. When one print is judged sufficiently toned, it
      is removed to a dish containing pure water, and another untoned print
      placed in the dish in its stead. This operation is continued till all
      the prints are toned. We have heard that it has been suggested to place
      the prints in water containing a <a name="little" id="little"></a><ins title="Original has littler">little</ins> acetic acid or common salt, in
      order to stop the toning action continuing from the solution which may
      be held in the paper. The former is most undesirable, acetic acid, as we
      shall see presently, decomposing the fixing bath.
    </p>

    <p>
      As to the addition of common salt, we can scarcely give a favourable
      opinion regarding it. The addition of a chloride does, in truth, alter
      the colour of the deposited gold (see <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante</i>), and it may be this that
      gives rise to the opinion that it corrects toning action. Of one thing
      we have little doubt, however, and that is, that the addition of any
      large amount of common salt will tend to turn the albumenate of silver
      into chloride, which in fixing will materially weaken the print. When
      giving the formula of the toning baths, we have indicated the depth to
      which toning should take place. One great point to attend to is, that
      a print<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span> should not be a slatey colour when fixed, and that can only
      be avoided by stopping the toning action when the print arrives at a
      blue-purple stage.
    </p>

    <p>
      The toning bath, when used, should be replaced in the bottle, and we
      recommend that it be kept in a dark place, otherwise any chloride of
      silver which finds its way into the solution will darken and be a
      nucleus for the precipitation of gold from the solution. The energy of
      the toning bath would, in consequence, be wholly gone. It will be found
      that in very cold solutions formed in winter the toning action is much
      slower than in summer, and we need scarcely point out that this due to
      the fact that cold invariably retards chemical action. This retardation
      is not advantageous, and it will be found positively hurtful as to the
      colour of the precipitated gold. We therefore recommend that the toning
      solution and the dish in which it is to be poured should be warmed
      before the fire, the former to a temperature of about 70°F., and the
      latter a little higher. By this means the toning action will take place
      as rapidly as in warm weather, and the same tones be produced. It must
      be <a name="remembered" id="remembered"></a><ins title="Original has rememberd">remembered</ins> we are writing for all; not for those alone
      who have an elaborate arrangement for keeping their operating rooms
      at a good temperature in all weathers, but also for those who cannot
      afford the luxury. It is for this reason that we have given the above
      directions.

    <small>FIXING THE PRINT.</small></h2>

    <p class="noi">
      <span class="smcap">Sir J. Herschel</span> was the first to point out that hyposulphite of soda
      would dissolve chloride of silver, and subsequently it has been found
      that it dissolves almost every organic salt of silver. In our early
      chapters we gave some examples of this. When we add hyposulphite to a
      salt of silver, such as the chloride, we get one of two reactions, the
      formation of a nearly insoluble double hyposulphite of soda and silver,
      or a readily soluble one.

    <p>
      The first insoluble double hyposulphite is formed when there is only a
      small quantity of sodium hyposulphite present; the soluble kind when
      the sodium <a name="hyposulphite" id="hyposulphite"></a><ins title="Orignal has hypsulphite">hyposulphite</ins> is in excess. Since it is the
      soluble kind which we wish to form, it is manifest that the presence
      of a sufficiency of hyposulphite in the fixing bath is necessary. If
      not, we have left the insoluble form on the paper. If either of these
      two kinds of hyposulphite be made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span> in a test-tube, we can readily
      simulate the effect of atmospheric exposure. If slightly acid water be
      added to the hyposulphite, it will be seen, when chloride of silver has
      been dissolved by the hyposulphite, that the precipitate or solution
      commences to blacken, sulphide of silver being formed. On the other
      hand, if we take albumenate of silver, and dissolve it in hyposulphite
      of soda, we shall find that the addition of acid gradually causes a
      yellow-looking compound to separate out, and it is probably this body
      formed in the paper which causes the gradual yellowing of the whites of
      silver prints.
    </p>

    <p>
      What is taught us, then, by this observation is, that by thorough
      washing we must try and eliminate all traces of hyposulphite of silver,
      and, indeed, of the hyposulphite of soda, since the latter decomposes as
      rapidly in the presence of acid as does the silver compound.
    </p>

    <p>
      The formula for the fixing bath which we recommend is:&mdash;
    </p>

    <table summary="Weight" class="weight">
      <tr>
        <td>Sodium hyposulphite</td>
        <td class="tdr">4</td>
        <td>ounces</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Water</td>
        <td class="tdr">1</td>
        <td>pint</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>

        <td class="tdr"><span class="frac"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span></td>
        <td>drachm</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
      The addition of the ammonia prevents any possibility of an acid reaction
      arising, and otherwise softens the film of albumen and the size of
      the paper, causing more rapid fixation and more thorough washing.
      Another thing the ammonia does is, that it prevents, in a great
      measure, blistering of the film of albumen, which is common in some
      highly-albumenized paper.
    </p>

    <p>
      Experience has shown that one ounce of solid hyposulphite will fix with
      safety three sheets of paper, so that an idea can be formed of how much
      must be used for a day's printing. The hyposulphite bath which has been
      used one day should never be used the next, since it invariably contains
      the germs of decomposition in it from some cause or another. Indeed, the
      appearance of the solution indicates this is so, since it is usually of
      a yellow or brownish appearance.
    </p>

    <p>
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
      The time required for fixing a print varies with the thickness of
      the paper used. As a rule, prints on the medium-sized paper require
      ten minutes' soaking in the bath, whilst thick-size requires fifteen
      minutes. Whilst toning, the dish containing the hyposulphite should
      be kept in a gentle rocking motion, as in toning, and for the same
      reasons. Prints may be examined from time to time, to see how the
      fixing progresses. When a print is not quite fixed, small spots of dark
      appearance will be seen when it is examined by transmitted light. The
      operation of fixing should be continued after these disappear for at
      least three or four minutes, in order that the hyposulphite of soda in
      the dish may get impregnated with the double silver and sodium salt
      which is in the print, and thus render washing more effectual. It should
      be noted that the dish for fixing should be at least as long and wide
      as the dish used for toning; that it should be deeper when, as a rule,
      all the prints are fixed at one time. Care should be taken that dishes
      which are used for sensitizing, toning, or fixing, <i>should not be used
      for anything else</i>. The glaze of porcelain dishes is often soft, and
      frequently absorbs a certain amount of the solutions used. Thus, if
      a porcelain dish be used for a solution of any aniline dye, it will
      often be found that it is permanently stained. Colour in this last is
      merely indication of what happens with any other solution. It will thus
      be seen that it is a mistake to use a dish for fixing when the glaze
      is cracked, since old hyposulphite must find its way into the body of
      the fresh solution that may be used, and thus institute a spontaneous
      decomposition, and a consequent want of permanence in the print. For
      our own part, we believe that a gutta-percha dish is a safer dish to
      use than any other, since it is impervious to any solution, and can be
      well scoured after fixing, and before being again brought into use. We
      believe that much of the fading of prints may be traced to the use of
      unsuitable dishes for fixing.

    <small>WASHING THE PRINT.</small></h2>

    <p class="noi">
      <span class="smcap">There</span> are very many apparatus designed for washing prints; but
      we believe that, where few prints have to be treated, careful
      hand-washing is as superior to machine-washing, as hand-made paper
      is to machine-made. In our own practice we take the prints from the
      fixing-dish, and immerse them in a large puncheon of water, and allow
      them to soak for five minutes, after which we carefully pour off all
      the water, and replenish with fresh, in which we leave them for a
      quarter-of-an-hour. After that we take the prints and place them on a
      glass slab, and, with a <a name="squeegee" id="squeegee"></a><ins title="Original has squegee">squeegee</ins>, squeeze as much water
      as possible out of each separately; this we repeat twice. After two
      more washings of a quarter-of-an-hour, we then wash for half-an-hour,
      and, with a sponge, dab them as dry as possible, and again immerse for
      half-an-hour. After repeating this operation twice, we allow a stream of
      running water to pour into the puncheon for a couple of hours, carrying
      the stream through an india-rubber pipe, at the end of which is a glass
      tube, to the bottom of the puncheon, and so that the pour of water goes
      against the side. By this means there is a constant stir in the water,
      and the water flows over the edge of the puncheon. It is convenient
      to cut a notch in the top rim of the puncheon, so that the water may
      find an exit before reaching the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span> level of the rim. The prints are then
      taken out, sponged once more, and dried. By this arrangement we have got
      prints which are perfectly unfaded, though they have been in existence
      eighteen years, and have been to the tropics, and in the dampest
      climates. This method of washing, though tedious, should be applied to
      all prints; but, in the present day, it can hardly be hoped that it can
      be immediately adopted, on account of the attention it requires; we
      therefore describe an apparatus which can be used. It was designed by
      Mr. England, and consists of a working trough, as shown in the figure,
      which is automatically worked by an overshot wheel. We need not enter
      into the details of the invention, as they are self-evident.
    </p>

    <div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
    <img src="images/fig28.jpg" width="300" height="200" alt="" />
    <div class="caption"><i>Fig.</i> 28.</div>
    </div>

    <p>
      This washing arrangement causes the prints to be alternately soaking
      in water, and draining. Whilst in the water they are perpetually being
      shaken apart by the movement of the tray, and thus every part of the
      print gets washed, and it is almost impossible for two prints to stick
      together. In all washing apparatus there is a danger of air-bells
      forming on the surface of the prints while in the water, but in this
      form there is the advantage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span> that whilst draining the air-bells must
      break, and so water on rising to the level of the prints can obliterate
      any of the evil effects which would be caused by their being perpetually
      remaining on one spot. It is useless to attempt to describe other forms
      of the apparatus, since there are so many; we have chosen one which
      appears to us to be a satisfactory form.

      The gelatine is first swelled in cold water, and then dissolved in hot
      water, and the remaining components of the formulæ are added. It is
      then filtered, and the paper is floated for three minutes, following
      the directions given on <a href="#Page_10">page 10</a>. If it be required to obtain a print on
      plain paper in a hurry, a wash of citric acid and water (one grain to
      the ounce) may be brushed over the back of ordinary albumenized paper,
      and, when dried, that side of the paper may be sensitized and printed in
      the ordinary manner. For cold tones the wash of the citric acid may be
      omitted.

      To Mr. Henry Cooper we are indebted for a valuable printing process,
      founded on substituting resins for albumen or other sizing matter. The
      prints obtained by this process are very beautiful, and lack that gloss
      of albumen which is often called vulgar and inartistic.

      The second formula gives very beautiful prints, soft and delicate in
      gradation.

    <p>
      The paper is first coated with an emulsion of white lac in gelatine,
      which is prepared as follows:&mdash;
    </p>

    <p>
      3 ounces of <em>fresh</em> white lac are dissolved in 1 pint of strong alcohol,
      and after filtering or decanting, as much water is added as it will bear
      without precipitating the lac; 1 ounce of good gelatine is soaked and
      dissolved in the pint of boiling water, and the lac solution is added
      with frequent stirring. If, at any stage of this operation, the gelatine
      is precipitated, a little more hot water must be added. The pint of lac
      solution ought, however, to be emulsified in the gelatine solution.
    </p>

    <p>
      To use the emulsion, it is warmed, and the paper immersed in or floated
      on it for three minutes. When dry, the coated surface is floated in the
      following for a couple of minutes:&mdash;

      2 dr. of sodium acetate are to be placed in the stock-bottle, and the
      above solution filtered on to it. This is made up to 20 ounces, and is
      fit for use in a few hours; but it improves by keeping.
    </p>

    <p>
      In commencing to tone, place a few ounces of water in the dish, and add
      an equal quantity of the stock solution, and if the toning begins to
      flag a little, add more of it from time to time.
    </p>

    <p>
      With the resin processes over-toning is to be carefully avoided.
    </p>

    <p>
      Resinized paper may be obtained from most photographic dealers,
      we believe, and for some purposes is an admirable substitute for
      albumenized paper.

    <small>PRINTING ON GELATINO-CHLORIDE EMULSION PAPER.</small></h2>

    <p class="noi">
      <span class="smcap">Mr. W. T. Wilkinson</span> has recently brought forward the notion of using
      gelatine instead of albumen as a medium for holding the silver chloride
      in printing. He uses the following formula:&mdash;
    </p>

    <table summary="Weight" class="weight">
      <tr>
        <td>Barium chloride</td>
        <td class="tdr">2,440</td>

      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Gelatine</td>

        <td>ounces</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
      The gelatine is allowed to swell in the water, and, by the aid of heat,
      is dissolved; the barium chloride is then added. Next he prepares&mdash;
    </p>

    <table summary="Weight" class="weight">
      <tr>
        <td>Silver nitrate</td>
        <td class="tdr">1,700</td>
        <td>grains</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>

      and adds this to the former, little by little, in a large bottle with
      much shaking, or pours it slowly into the former in a large jar,
      stirring briskly the whole time. This makes an emulsion of silver
      chloride, and is used without washing. When required for use, the
      gelatine, which will have set when cold, is swelled by placing the jar
      containing it in hot water, and is then transferred to a dish. The dish
      should be kept warm by being placed, supported on small blocks, in a tin
      tray (about two inches larger in dimensions every way than the dish)
      filled with hot water, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span> temperature of which should be about 150° F.
      to commence with. Saxe or Rive paper may be coated by rolling the sheet
      face outwards, and placing the edge of the roll upon the gelatine. The
      two corners of the paper in contact with the solution are then taken
      hold of by the fingers, and raised. The paper will unroll of itself, and
      take up a thin layer of the gelatine emulsion. The sheet of paper is
      then suspended to dry. All these operations are, of course, conducted
      in the dark room. The behaviour of the paper in the printing-frame is
      precisely the same as albumenized paper, and the washing and toning are
      conducted in the same way. For a fixing bath is used&mdash;
    </p>

    <table summary="Weight" class="weight">
      <tr>
        <td>Sodium hyposulphite</td>
        <td class="tdr">2</td>
        <td>ounces</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Water</td>
        <td class="tdr">20</td>
        <td class="center">"</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
      The washing after fixing is more rapid than with albumenized paper. It
      is washed in ten or twelve changes of water for ten minutes, and then
      placed for five minutes in an alum bath made as follows:&mdash;
    </p>

    <table summary="Weight" class="weight">
      <tr>
        <td>Potash alum</td>
        <td class="tdr">5</td>
        <td>ounces</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Water</td>
        <td class="tdr">20</td>
        <td class="center">"</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p class="noi">
      The print is washed in a few changes of water, and the prints are ready
      for drying and mounting. The advantage of the alum bath is that the
      hyposulphite is destroyed into harmless products, and the gelatine is
      rendered insoluble by it. In the formula given there is large excess
      of chloride, and we recommend that instead of using 2,440 grains of
      barium chloride, 2,050 grains be used. (Mr. Wilkinson has used that
      amount of the barium salt that would be required exactly to convert
      1,700 grains of silver nitrate into silver chloride, if the formula for
      barium chloride were BaCl<sub>3</sub> instead of BaCl<sub>2</sub>.) It will be seen
      that whichever formula is used, there is no silver left to combine with
      the gelatine, and hence the image will be entirely formed by metallic
      silver, and not an organic salt of silver.

    <small>DRYING THE PRINTS.</small></h2>

    <p class="noi">
      <span class="smcap">In</span> many establishments the prints are taken direct from the washing
      water, and hung up by American clips, and thus allowed to dry. When this
      is done, the prints curl up as the water leaves the paper, and they
      become somewhat unmanageable. If prints have to be dried at all before
      mounting&mdash;and they must, unless they are trimmed before toning&mdash;a better
      plan is to make a neat heap of some fifty or sixty of the same size (say
      cartes), place them on blotting-paper, and drain for a time, and then in
      a screw-press (such as is used to press table-cloths, for instance) to
      squeeze out all superfluous water. After a good hard squeeze the prints
      should be separated, and the plan adopted by Mr. England carried out. He
      has frames of light laths made, of about 6 feet by 3 feet, and over this
      frame is stretched ordinary paperhanger's canvas. The prints are laid
      on this to dry spontaneously, and they cockle up but very little. The
      frames, being light, are easily handled. After the squeezing is done,
      supposing the room in which they are placed be not very damp or very
      cold, the prints will be ready for trimming and mounting in a couple of
      hours. To our minds there is nothing superior to this mode of drying,
      since the squeezing in the press tends to eliminate every slight trace
      of hyposulphite which might be left in them.
    </p>

    <p>
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
      <em>Trimming the Prints.</em>&mdash;Perhaps more prints are ruined in trimming than
      in any other way, when the operator is inexperienced, since it requires
      judgment to know which part of the print to trim off, so that a right
      balance shall be kept. In trimming landscape prints, it is impossible
      to give any set rules; the judgment as to what is artistic must be the
      guide. Of one thing we may be certain, that, unless the operator who
      took the original negative knows exactly how to balance his picture on
      the focussing-screen, the print will always bear cutting down in one
      direction or the other. Such a clipping, of course, alters the size of
      the print, which, if it be one of a series, will be a misfortune; but,
      on the other hand, the artistic value of the individual print will be
      increased.
    </p>

    <p>
      For portraits there are some few rules which should be followed in
      trimming. Always allow the centre of the face to be a little "out" from
      the central line of the print, making more space on the side towards
      which the sitter is looking. Allow a carte or cabinet to be cut in
      such a way that, if the sitter has been leaning on something, it does
      not seem as if he had been leaning on nothing. Should there be an
      unintentional lean on the part of the sitter, trim the print so that he
      appears in an upright position.
    </p>

    <p>
      To trim the print, there should be the various sized shapes in glass
      used. Thus there should be glasses with bevelled edges for the carte,
      the cabinet, and other sizes, which can be laid on the print as a guide
      to the trimming. The absolute trimming may be done either by shears
      or by a knife, a leather cutters' knife being excellent, since it is
      rounded, and can be brought to a keen edge very readily. When the knife
      is used, the print is placed on a large glass sheet of good thickness,
      the pattern placed over it, and, whilst this is held down by the left
      hand, the knife is used by the right, keeping it close to the edge of
      the pattern glass. When shears are used, the print is held against the
      pattern glass by the left hand, and each side trimmed by one clip,
      taking care to make the cut parallel to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span> edges of the pattern glass.
      It requires a little practice to prevent clipping the glass as well as
      the paper, but for small sized prints, such as the carte, the shears
      have a decided advantage over the knife.
    </p>

    <p>
      For cutting out ovals, Robinson's trimmer is an excellent adjunct to the
      mounting-room, and in this case ovals stamped out of sheet brass are
      used as guides.
    </p>

    <div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
    <img src="images/fig29.jpg" width="300" height="69" alt="" />
    <div class="caption"><i>Fig.</i> 29.</div>
    </div>

    <p>
      The figure will show the action of the trimmer. The small wheel is the
      cutter, and, being pivotted, it follows the curve against which it is
      held. It is better to cut out prints with this trimmer on sheet zinc
      in preference to glass, the edge of the wheel being kept sharp for a
      longer time than where the harder glass is used. To use the trimmer,
      the print is placed on the sheet of zinc, the oval mask (or square
      mask, with slightly rounded corners) is placed in position on it. The
      wheel of the trimmer is brought parallel to, and against, the edge of
      the mask, the handle being grasped by the right hand, the thumb to the
      left, and the fingers on the right. A fairly heavy downward pressure
      is brought to bear on the trimmer, and at the same time the wheel is
      caused to run along the edge of the mask. The cut should be clean, and
      the join perfect, if proper care be taken. It is desirable to practise
      on ordinary writing paper before it is taken into use for prints. Square
      masks with very slightly rounded corners can be used; the smaller the
      wheel, the less curved the corners need be. It will be seen that there
      is a limit to smallness of the wheel used, since, if too small, the
      stirrup on which it is pivoted would rest upon the mask. The larger the
      wheel the easier is the cutting.
    </p>

    <p>
      With larger sizes than the carte or the cabinet, mounting may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span> often
      have to be delayed, since it is easier to keep a stock of unmounted
      prints (say landscapes) unmounted than it is when they are mounted. In
      this case the prints should be put away as flat as possible. The plan
      of drying we have indicated takes out the "curl," but even then they
      will not be flat enough to be handily put away. We therefore recommend
      the practice of stroking the prints. A flat piece of hard wood, about 1
      foot long and 1<span class="frac"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> inch broad, and the thickness of a marquoise scale,
      has its edges carefully rounded off. The print is seized by one corner
      in one hand and unrolled; the face of the print is brought in contact
      with a piece of plate glass. The "stroker," held by the other hand,
      is brought with its rounded edge on to the back of the print near the
      corner held by the first hand. Considerable pressure is brought upon the
      stroker, and the print is drawn through between it and the plate. The
      print is then seized by another corner and similarly treated. By this
      means a gloss is put upon the print, and the creases and cockles are
      obliterated. The print is now ready for trimming.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is well to have a square of glass with true edges cut to the size of
      the pictures. The prints should be trimmed upon a sheet of plate glass,
      a sharp penknife being used to cut them. A rough test for ascertaining
      if the opposite sides are equal is to bring them together, and see if
      both corners coincide.
    </p>

    <p>
      It may sometimes be found useful to cut out a print into an oval. The
      following method for tracing any ellipse may be employed:&mdash;On a thickish
      piece of clean paper draw a line A B, making it the <em>extreme</em> width of
      the oval required. Bisect it at O, and draw D O C at right angles to A
      B. Make O C equal to <em>half</em> the smallest diameter of the ellipse. With
      the centre C and the distance O B, draw an arc of a circle, cutting A
      B in E and F. Place the paper on a flat board, and at E and F fix two
      drawing-pins. Take a piece of thread and knot it together in such a
      manner that half its length is equal to A F. Place the thread round the
      two pins at E and F, and stretch it out to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span> tightness by the point of a
      lead pencil. Move the pencil guided by the cotton, taking care to keep
      it upright. The resulting figure will be an ellipse. Modifications of
      this figure may be made by making a second knot beyond the first knot,
      and placing the point of the pencil in the loop formed. When the figure
      has been traced in pencil on paper, it should be carefully cut out with
      a sharp penknife, and placed on the print which is to be trimmed into an
      oval. When so placed, a faint pencil line is run round on the print, and
      the cutting out proceeds either by scissors or penknife.

      as the medium will cause the adherence of the back of the print to the
      cardboard employed, they are perfectly satisfied, whether it be paste
      fresh or sour, or starch or gelatine in a similar condition. If any of
      our readers have had the misfortune to have their rooms papered with
      rancid paste, they will have noticed that the unpleasant smell attending
      it has not been removed from the room for weeks, and that there is a
      liability of the return of the disgusting odour when the air is at all
      damp. In this case the fact that decomposition is going on is detected
      by the olfactory nerves, because the quantity is considerable. It is
      none the less true, however, that every square inch of the surface of
      the wall paper is undergoing the same ordeal, and that if it contains
      any colour, &amp;c., which would be affected by decomposing organic matter,
      there would be but small chance of the paper retaining its fresh
      appearance. Were a silver print mounted with the same paste, we need
      scarcely point out that danger to its permanency is to be apprehended.
      Paste, we know, is as a rule tabooed, but there is no occasion for it
      to be so if care be taken that it is absolutely fresh when employed in
      mounting. In looking for a mounting material, we should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span> endeavour to
      find something which does not readily take up moisture. Glue, gelatine,
      dextrine, and gum are all inadmissible on this account; on the other
      hand, starch, arrowroot, cornflour, and gum tragacanth, when once dry,
      do not seem to attract moisture.
    </p>

    <p>
      Referring to glue, Mr. W. Brooks says<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote-29" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 29">[29]</a> that he has recently seen
      many photographs which have been mounted with that medium, and in
      some cases, where the glue has been put on too thickly, it swells up
      into ridges, showing marks of the brush with which it is applied, and
      each ridge after a time turns brown. The same writer is not wholly in
      favour of starch, but in our own opinion pure white starch is as good
      a material as can be met with. To prepare it for use as a mountant,
      a large teaspoonful of starch is placed in the bottom of a cup, with
      just sufficient cold water to cover it. This is allowed to remain for
      a couple of minutes, after which the cup is filled with boiling water,
      and well stirred; the starch should then be fairly thick, but not
      so thick as to prevent a brush taking up a proper supply for a good
      sized print. We will suppose that we are going to mount a day's work
      of carte-de-visite prints. In a former chapter we have said that it
      is desirable that the prints should be left damp. If they are dried,
      they should be <em>slightly</em> moistened, and placed in a heap one above the
      other, as by so doing the moisture is confined, and one damping of all
      the prints is sufficient. In our own practice we have, as is natural,
      all the prints with the faces downwards. A stiff bristle brush is then
      dipped into the pot containing the starch, and the starch brushed over
      the back of the top print. This one is then carefully raised from the
      print beneath it, and, supposing it to have been properly trimmed, it
      is laid upon the card, and pressed down by means of a soft cloth, and
      placed on one side to dry. The next print is then treated in the same
      manner, and so on. By this plan no starch gets on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
      the face of the prints, which is a desideratum. With a little practice,
      just sufficient starch will be brushed on each carte, and no more. Young
      hands, however, are sometimes apt to give more than a fair share to
      them; in this case, after pressing the print down with the soft cloth,
      it may be useful to place on the print a piece of writing paper, and
      press all superfluous starch out by a rounded straight-edge, or an ivory
      or wooden paper knife. The card in this case should be placed on a slab
      of thick glass, so as give an even pressure. The starch, which will
      exude beyond the edges of the card, should be carefully wiped off with a
      <em>clean</em> cloth.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is of course a method to be adopted only in the case of bungling
      mounting, but it is useful then, and may save a carte. It should be
      remembered that the less mounting medium used, the greater is the chance
      of a silver print not fading.
    </p>

    <p>
      To mount larger prints, the back should be slightly damped, and the
      brush with the starch applied with cross strokes, so that every part is
      covered. Particular care should be taken that the corners and edges are
      not missed, since it often necessitates re-mounting the print, which is
      to be avoided as far as possible, since it is a troublesome matter. The
      rounded-edged ruler, and the sheet of white paper, is also useful here,
      since over a large surface there is more difficulty in getting even
      layers of starch, than over smaller ones. When a print has to be mounted
      with a margin, the places where the top corners have to come should be
      marked with a fine pencil point. By a little dexterity, the top edge of
      the print, the back of which has been covered with starch in the manner
      described, can be brought into the position indicated by these dots,
      and be then lowered without puckers or folds. It should be remembered
      that the print should just cover the pencil marks, since it is almost
      impossible to erase blacklead with india-rubber, if any starch should by
      accident get on it.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is well to dry these prints under pressure, since the cardboard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span> is
      apt to cockle. A couple of boards rather longer than the prints suffice
      for the purpose. The mounted prints are laid between them, a sheet
      of clean blotting-paper separating each, and a few weights placed on
      the top board. For prints of moderate size, a table-cloth press is an
      excellent substitute.
    </p>

    <p>
      As to the kind of mounts to be used, opinions vary. To our mind, the
      simpler they are, the better they look. It is not rare to find a regular
      advertisement of the photographic establishment below a carte or cabinet
      print. To say the least of it, this is bad taste, and we are sure it is
      bad art. If the work be good, it needs no recommendation; and if it be
      bad, the less of an advertisement that appears, the better it is for
      the photographer. At the back of a carte or cabinet is the place where
      any advertisement should appear; but even here it may be overdone. When
      we find the back of the carte got up with any amount of gold-lettering
      flourishes, and no blank space on which the eye can rest without
      encountering some one especial merit of the artist, we may expect to
      find on the front of the card the same kind of tawdry work. It is
      seldom advisable to have the mount of a white colour, though for cartes
      or cabinets, in which the margin will be hidden in the album, this is
      not of much consequence; but for prints in which the margin shows, it
      is generally advisable to have some slight tint visible, preferably
      of a cream or buff colour. There are some classes of work which will,
      however, bear a white margin, but it is rarely the case; and we advise,
      as a general rule, that there should be some tone on it, to prevent
      its attracting the eye away from the picture by its whiteness. Black
      mounts are much in vogue at the present time, and they are effective and
      artistic; but chemical analysis has shown them not to be safe, since
      they are enamelled with substances which are apt to induce fading. A
      good and stable black mount is a desideratum, which it is to be hoped
      will be found before long.
    </p>

    <p>
      Notwithstanding our preference for starch as a mountant, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span> give a
      method of preparing glue for the same purpose. The glue used should
      be light, and as clean as possible. It should be shredded and soaked
      in sufficient clean water to cover it for five or six hours; any dust
      which may have adhered to it will find its way into the water. The water
      should be poured off and replaced by an equal quantity of fresh. The
      vessel containing it is heated over a small gas jet or spirit lamp until
      solution takes place. The liquid is then thinned down with warm water
      till it is of proper consistency, a point which is soon learned by a
      little practice. An ordinary small glue pot will be found convenient.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is sometimes useful to have at hand a mounting solution which will
      not cockle the mount, and the late Mr. G. Wharton Simpson gave a formula
      which is very good in this respect. Fine cut gelatine or shredded glue
      is swollen in the least possible quantity of water, and this is boiled
      with alcohol, with much stirring. If 80 grains of Nelson's No. 1 fine
      cut gelatine are taken, 3 dr. of water should be used for making it, and
      to it 2 oz. of alcohol be added. When cool this sets into a jelly, and
      can be used by letting the bottle into which it has been transferred
      stand in hot water. Prints can be mounted on foolscap paper with this
      medium without any serious cockling being apparent.
    </p>

    <p>
      It should be recollected that no two batches of paper will mount exactly
      alike, some expanding more than others. It is well to mount a trial
      print before doing many, to see exactly how the paper under manipulation
      behaves.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Rolling the Prints.</em>&mdash;After the prints have been under the hands of the
      retoucher, they should be rolled in a rolling-press in order to give a
      brightness to the printed image. It would be invidious to point out any
      particular press that should be used. Suffice it to say, there are many
      excellent ones in the market. The directions for cleaning and using the
      press are supplied with each machine; we therefore refrain from saying
      anything about them.

    <small>DEFECTS IN PRINTS.</small></h2>

    <p class="noi">
      <span class="smcap">The</span> bath solution is sometimes repelled by the paper, and this is found
      chiefly in highly albumenized paper, and is generally caused by the
      paper being too dry. Passing the sheet of paper over the steam from a
      saucepan will generally effect a cure.
    </p>

    <p>
      Small white spots, with a black central pin-point, are often met with in
      prints. Dust on the paper during sensitizing will cause them, the grit
      forming a nucleus for a minute bubble. All paper should be thoroughly
      dusted before being floated on the sensitizing bath.
    </p>

    <p>
      Grey, star-like spots arise from small particles of inorganic matter,
      such as ferric oxide, lime, &amp;c., which are present in the paper. They
      become more apparent by decomposition during the printing operations.
      They may generally be discernible by examining the paper by transmitted
      light.
    </p>

    <p>
      Bronze lines (straight) occur through a stoppage during floating the
      paper in the sensitizing solution. Should the lines be irregular,
      forming angles and curves, it is probable that a scum of silver oxide,
      &amp;c., may be detected on the surface of the sensitizing solution. A strip
      of blotting-paper drawn across the bath will remove the cause of the
      defect.
    </p>

    <p>
      Should the print appear marbled, it may be surmised that the sensitizing
      solution is weak, or that the paper has not been floated sufficiently.
      In some cases it may arise from imperfect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span> albumenizing; but in ordinary
      commercial samples the cause can be easily traced.
    </p>

    <p>
      Red marks on the shadows may appear during toning, and are very
      conspicuous after fixing. They generally arise from handling the paper
      with hot, moist fingers after sensitizing; greasy matter being deposited
      on the surface, prevents the toning bath acting properly on such parts.
    </p>

    <p>
      Weak prints are generally caused by weak negatives. Such can be
      partially remedied by paying attention to the strength of the
      sensitizing bath (see <a href="#appendix">Appendix</a>), and by using washed paper.
    </p>

    <p>
      Harsh prints are due to harsh negatives. They can generally be remedied
      by paying attention to the mode of printing, as given in <a href="#ix">Chapter IX.</a> If
      the negative be under-exposed and wanting in detail, there is, however,
      no cure for this defect.
    </p>

    <p>
      A red tone is due to insufficient toning; whilst a poor and blue tone is
      due to an excess of toning.
    </p>

    <p>
      The whites may appear yellow from imperfect washing, imperfect toning,
      imperfect fixing, or from the use of old sensitized paper.
    </p>

    <p>
      Should prints refuse to tone, either the gold has been exhausted, or
      else a trace of sodium hyposulphite has been carried into the toning
      bath by the fingers or other means. A trace of hyposulphite is much more
      injurious to the print than a fair quantity of it. Should the toning
      bath refuse to tone after the addition of gold, it may be presumed that
      it is contaminated by a trace of sodium hyposulphite.
    </p>

    <p>
      A dark mottled appearance in the body of the paper indicates imperfect
      fixing, combined with the action of light on the unaltered chloride
      during fixing. If the fixing bath be acid, the excess of acid combines
      with the sulphur, and forms hydrosulphuric acid, which will also cause
      the defect.
    </p>

      The cause of mealiness or "measles" in the print has been explained in

    <small>ENCAUSTIC PASTE.</small></h2>

    <p class="noi">
      <span class="smcap">The</span> value of an encaustic paste in improving the effect of photographic
      prints has become very generally recognised amongst photographers.
      A good encaustic confers three special benefits on the print: it
      gives depth, richness, and transparency to the shadows; it renders
      apparent delicate detail in the lights which would otherwise remain
      imperceptible; and it aids in protecting the surface, and so tends to
      permanency. One of the writers has in his possession prints that were
      treated with an encaustic paste thirteen years ago, which retain all
      their original freshness and purity, while prints done at the same time
      from the same negatives have gone, to say the least of it, "off colour."
    </p>

    <p>
      Various formulæ for the preparation of encaustic pastes have been
      published, and many of them very excellent. The qualities required are,
      easiness of application, and the capacity of giving richness and depth
      without too much gloss, and of yielding a hard, firm, permanent surface.
      For a proper combination of all these qualities, nothing has ever
      approached the paste of the late Adam-Salomon, of which the following is
      the formula:&mdash;

      The wax is cut into shreds, and melted in a capsule over a water
      bath. Placing it in a jar, and the latter in a pan of hot water, will
      serve. Powder the elemi, and dissolve it in the solvent, using gentle
      heat. Some samples of elemi are soft and tough, and will not admit of
      powdering, in which case it may be roughly divided into small portions,
      and placed in a bottle with the solvents. Strain through muslin, and add
      the clear solution to the melted wax, and stir well. It is then poured
      into a wide-mouthed bottle, and allowed to cool.
    </p>

    <p>
      The encaustic paste is put on the prints in patches, and then rubbed
      with a light, quick motion, with a piece of flannel, until a firm, fine
      surface is obtained.

    <small>ENAMELLING PRINTS.</small></h2>

    <p class="noi">
      <span class="smcap">There</span> are several modes of enamelling prints, but there is none better
      than that described by Mr. W. England, which we quote in his words.
      "I have a glass having a good polished surface (patent plate is not
      necessary), and rub over it some powdered French chalk tied up in a
      muslin bag. Dust off the superfluous chalk with a camel's hair brush,
      and coat with enamel collodion. I find it an improvement to add to the
      collodion usually sold for the purpose 2 dr. of castor oil to the pint.
      When the collodion is well set, immerse the plate in a dish of water.
      When several prints are required to be enamelled, a sufficient number
      of plates may be prepared and put in dishes; this will save time. Now
      take the first plate, and well wash under a tap till all greasiness
      has disappeared; place it on a levelling stand, and pour on as much
      water as the plate will hold. Then lay the print on the top, squeeze
      out all the water, and place the plate and print between several
      thicknesses of blotting-paper to remove all superfluous moisture. The
      plate, with the print in contact, should now be placed in a warm room
      to dry spontaneously, when the print will come easily from the glass.
      Care should be taken not to attempt to remove the print till quite
      dry.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span> If the pictures required to be enamelled have been dried, it
      will be necessary to rub over them some ox-gall with a plug of soft

      blisters when laid on the collodion.

    <p>
      "I may mention that prints done in this way lose their very glossy

    <small>CAMEO PRINTS.</small></h2>

    <p class="noi">
      <span class="smcap">At</span> one time there was a rage amongst photographers to produce cameos,

      applied. In some cases the carte itself was gelatinized, dried, and
      damped, and placed in contact with the collodion film. The carte was
      placed face downwards on the gelatine, and placed under pressure till
      quite dry. It was then removed, and bore on its surface a high gloss

    <h3><span class="smcap">Reduction of Over-Exposed Prints.</span></h3>

    <p class="noi">
      <span class="smcap">Mr. England</span> writes as follows to the Photographic Journal, and we can
      unhesitatingly say that the method of reducing an over-printed proof is
      excellent.
    </p>

    <p>
      "A simple and certain method of reducing over-printed proofs has been
      one of the wants long felt by all photographers. It is well known that
      in every photographic establishment even the most careful printers
      cannot always be sure of getting the exact depth of tone required, and
      proofs occasionally get over-printed. Of course prevention is better
      than cure; but, when a remedy is necessary, the method I am about to
      describe answers admirably. I tried a great many experiments before I
      succeeded to my satisfaction. I found that cyanide of potassium totally
      destroyed the print, even when used moderately strong. By using a weaker
      solution it was well under control, and the exact depth could be readily
      obtained; but during the washing to remove the cyanide the action of
      the latter continued, and spoiled every proof. I then tried several
      methods to arrest the action of the cyanide, but without success. It
      then occurred to me to use the cyanide in such a weak state that but
      little should be held in the paper, only sufficient to reduce the print
      to the required depth; for this purpose I made a bath of only four drops
      of saturated solution of cyanide to a pint of water. The prints immersed
      at first showed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span> no signs of getting lighter, but after about an hour
      the most perfect results had been obtained with prints considerably
      over-printed. With lighter pictures a less time is required. Proofs
      treated in this way lose nothing of their tone during the after-washing,
      which should be thoroughly done, and, when dry, retain all the
      brilliancy of an ordinary print."
    </p>

    <p>
      The plan of using cyanide has, we know, often been proposed, but with
      no success until, we believe, Mr. W. Brooks gave a formula which worked
      successfully with him.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another plan, proposed by Mr. L. Warnerke, for effecting the same thing
      is the use of ferric sulphate. A weak solution is prepared, and the
      print immersed in it. The reduction takes place rapidly, but evenly.
    </p>

    <p>
      We need scarcely say that it is better not to have to use either of
      these remedies, by avoiding over-printing; but as mistakes will occur,
      it is evident that the above will be of use at times.
    </p>

    <h3><span class="smcap">Utilization of Silver Residues.</span></h3>

    <p>
      All paper or solutions in which there is silver should be saved, as it
      has been proved by experience that from 50 to 75 per cent. of the whole
      of the silver used can be recovered by rigid adherence to the careful
      storage of "wastes."
    </p>

    <p>
      1. All prints should be trimmed, if practicable, before toning and
      fixing; in all cases these clippings should be collected. When a good
      basketful of them is collected, these, together with the bits of
      blotting-paper attached to the bottom end of sensitized paper during
      drying, and that used for the draining of plates, should be burnt in a
      stove, and the ashes collected. These ashes will naturally occupy but a
      small space in comparison with the paper itself. Care should be taken
      that the draught from the fire is not strong enough to carry up the
      ashes.
    </p>

    <p>
      2. All washings from prints, waters used in the preparation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span> dry
      plates, all baths, developing solutions (after use), and old toning
      baths, should be placed in a tub, and common salt added. This will form
      silver chloride.
    </p>

    <p>
      3. The old hyposulphite baths used in printing should be placed in
      another tub. To this the potassium sulphide of commerce may be added.
      Silver sulphide is thus formed.
    </p>

    <p>
      4. To No. 1 nitric acid may be added, and the ashes boiled in it till
      no more silver is extracted by it. The solution of silver nitrate thus
      produced is filtered off through white muslin, and put aside for further
      treatment, when common salt is added to it to form chloride, and added
      to No. 2.
    </p>

    <p>
      5. The ashes may still contain silver chloride. This may be dissolved
      out by adding a solution of sodium hyposulphite, and adding the filtrate
      No. 3.
    </p>

    <p>
      6. No. 2, after thoroughly drying, may be reduced to metallic silver
      in a reducing crucible<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote-30" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 30">[30]</a> by addition of two parts of sodium carbonate
      and a little borax to one of the silver chloride. These should be well
      mixed together, and placed in the covered crucible in a coke fire, and
      gradually heated. If the operator be in possession of one of Fletcher's
      gas furnaces he can employ it economically, and with far less trouble
      than using the fire. (It is supplied with an arrangement for holding
      crucibles, which is useful for the purpose.) After a time, on lifting
      off the cover, it will be found that the silver is reduced to a metallic
      state. After all seething has finished, the crucible should be heated
      to a white heat for a quarter of an hour. The molten silver should be
      turned out into an iron pan (previously rubbed over with plumbago to
      prevent the molten metal spirting), and immersed in a pail of water. The
      washing should be repeated till nothing but the pure silver remains.
    </p>

    <p>
      The silver hyposulphite, having been reduced to the sulphide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span> by the
      addition of the potassium sulphide, is placed in a crucible, and
      subjected to a white heat; the sulphur is driven off, and the silver
      remains behind.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another method of reducing silver chloride to the metallic state is by
      placing it in water slightly acidulated with sulphuric acid together
      with granulated zinc. The zinc is attacked, evolving hydrogen, which, in
      its turn, reduces the silver chloride to the metallic state, and forming
      hydrochloric acid. After well washing, the silver may be dissolved up in
      nitric acid.
    </p>

    <p>
      Yet another method is to take sugar of milk and a solution of crude
      potash, when the silver is rapidly reduced. This requires careful
      washing, and it is well to heat the metal to a dull red heat to get rid
      of any adherent and insoluble organic matter which may have been formed,
      before dissolving it in nitric acid.
    </p>

    <h3><span class="smcap">To Print from Weak and Hard Negatives.</span></h3>

    <p>
      Should a negative be found very hard, a slight modification of the
      sensitizing solution will be found beneficial, supposing the ordinary
      paper is to be used.
    </p>

    <table summary="Weight" class="weight">
      <tr>
        <td>Silver nitrate</td>
        <td class="tdr">30</td>
        <td>grains</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Water</td>
        <td class="tdr">1</td>
        <td>ounce</td>
    </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
      The negative should in this case be printed in the sun. The more intense
      the light, the less contrast there will be in the print, as the stronger
      light more rapidly effects a change in the albuminate than if subjected
      to weaker diffused light. The reason for the reduction in quantity of
      the silver nitrate in the solution is given on <a href="#Page_15">page 15</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      To print from a weak negative, the sensitizing solution should be:&mdash;
    </p>

    <table summary="Weight" class="weight">
      <tr>
        <td>Silver nitrate</td>
        <td class="tdr">80</td>
        <td>grains</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Water</td>
        <td class="tdr">1</td>
        <td>ounce</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
      The printing should take place in the shade; the weaker the negative,
      the more diffused the light should be.
    </p>

    <p>
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
      If a negative be dense, but all the gradations of light and shade be
      perfect, the strong bath, and, if, possible, a strongly-salted paper,
      should be used. The printing should take place in sunlight.
    </p>

    <h3><span class="smcap">To Make Gold Tri-Chloride</span> [<small>AU CL<sub>3</sub></small>].</h3>

    <p>
      Place a half-sovereign (which may contain silver as well as copper) in a
      convenient vessel; pour on it half a drachm of nitric acid, and mix with
      it two-and-a-half drachms of hydrochloric acid; digest at a gentle heat,
      but do not boil, or probably the chlorine will be driven off. At the
      expiration of a few hours add a similar quantity of the acids. Probably
      this will be sufficient to dissolve all the gold. If not, add acid the
      third time; all will have been dissolved by this addition, excepting,
      perhaps, a trace of silver, which will have been deposited by the
      excess of hydrochloric acid as silver chloride. If a precipitate should
      have been formed, filter it out, and wash the filter paper well with
      distilled water. Take a filtered solution of ferrous sulphate (eight
      parts water to one of iron) acidulated with a few drops of hydrochloric
      acid, and add the gold solution to it; the iron will cause the gold
      alone to deposit as metallic gold, leaving the copper in solution. By
      adding the gold solution to the iron the precipitate is not so fine as
      if added <em>vice versa</em>. Let the gold settle, and pour off the liquid;
      add water, and drain again, and so on till no acid is left, testing
      the washings by litmus paper. Take the metallic gold which has been
      precipitated, re-dissolve in the acids as before, evaporate to dryness
      on a water bath (that is, at a heat not exceeding 212° F.) The resulting
      substance is the gold tri-chloride. To be kept in crystals this should
      be placed in glass tubes hermetically sealed. For non-commercial
      purposes it is convenient to dissolve it in water (one drachm to a grain
      of gold). Ten grains of gold dissolved yield 15.4 grains of the salt.
      Hence if ten grains have been dissolved, 15.4 drachms of water must be
      added to give the above strength.
    </p>

    <h3><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
    <span class="smcap">To Make Silver Nitrate.</span></h3>

    <p>
      Silver coins are mostly alloyed with tin or copper. In both cases the
      coin should be dissolved in nitric acid diluted with twice its bulk
      of water. If tin be present there will be an insoluble residue left
      of stannic oxide. The solution should be evaporated down to dryness,
      re-dissolved in water, filtered, and again evaporated to dryness.
      It will then be fit for making up a bath. If copper be present, the
      solution must be treated with silver oxide.
    </p>

    <p>
      The silver oxide thus formed is added, little by little, till the blue
      or greenish colour has entirely disappeared. This will precipitate the
      copper oxide from the copper nitrate, setting free the nitric acid,
      which, in its turn, will combine with the silver oxide. The copper will
      fall as a black powder mixed with any excess of silver oxide there may
      be. Take one or two drops of the solution in a measure, and add a drachm
      of water, and then add ammonia to it till the precipitate first formed
      is re-dissolved. If no blue colour is apparent, the substitution of the
      silver for the copper is complete; if not, more silver oxide must be
      added till the desired end is attained. Distilled water must next be
      added till the strength of the bath is that required. This can be tested
      by the argentometer.
    </p>

    <p>
      If to a solution of silver nitrate a solution of potash be added, a
      precipitate will be formed. This is the silver oxide. The potash should
      be added till no further precipitation takes place. The oxide should
      be allowed to settle, the supernatant fluid be decanted off (a syphon
      arrangement is very convenient), and fresh distilled water added to it.
      This, in its turn, after the oxide has been well stirred, should be
      decanted off. The operation should be repeated five or six times, to
      ensure all nitrate of potash being absent, though its presence does not
      matter for a printing bath, since this or some other nitrate is formed
      when the paper is floated.
